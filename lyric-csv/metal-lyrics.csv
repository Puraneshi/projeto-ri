Blood Fire Death|Bathory|metal|"death's star on horizon
lightning and rain
black winds and thunder
the skyline is in flames

written in the red mist
the sign of the one
who rides deaths cold wind
and walks disguised among

all you vagrant souls
of profane disbeliefs
false prophets and deceivers
shall swing from the trees

soon the dawn will arise
for all the oppressed to arm
a chariot of thunder shall be seen
and bronze horns shall sound the alarm

fists will raise like hammers
to a cloudy black sky
bonds and chains fall to the ground

children of all slaves
stand united and proud
all people of bondage shall triumph
and live by the sign of...

blood fire death

the moment is chosen
the battlefield's bare
take now thy stand people
the true ones don't fear

now choose your weapons
and fall in the line
choose well your colors
and follow your sign

blood for all tears shed
and fire for hate
death for what shall become
all false ones fate

the standard bearer is chosen
and the day has just begun
shadows growing long by the rising
of the awakening sun

fists raise like hammers
to a clear sunny sky
bonds and chains fallen to the ground

children of all slaves
now united and proud
all people of bondage now triumph
and live by the sign of...

blood fire death

children of all slaves
unite be proud
rise out of darkness and pain

a chariot of thunder and gold
will come loud
and a warrior of thunder and rain

with hair as white as snow
hammer of steel
to set you free of your chains

and to lead you all
where horses run free
and the souls of the ancient ones reign"
Immortal Rites|Morbid Angel|metal|"
gathered for a sacred rite
subconscious minds allied
call upon immortals
call upon the oldest ones to intercede

rid us of our human waste
cleanse our earthly lives
make us one with darkness
enlighten us to your ways


from churning worlds of mindlessness
come screams unheard before
haunting voices fill the room
their source remaining undefined
shadows cast from faceless beings
lost for centuries


lords of death, i summon you
reside within our brains
cast your spells upon our lives
so that we may receive
the gift of immortality
bestowed on those who seek you

Epitaph|Necrophagist|metal|"leaves fall in the autumn
of lives that appear
to be worthless to some
utmost ignorant

expectations shift in the eye
of the beholder...behold

tears drop from the eye
of lives paled
as jealousy fools
a mind distorted

of the beholder...behold

one wishes existence
to be of fulfillment
but leaves bend to the will
of winds blowing

to foresee the end
of a soul...epitaph

the end of a soul
premature epitaph

Internal Bleeding|Obituary|metal|"rot alone

Cry Of The Black Birds|Amon Amarth|metal|"raise your swords up high
see the black birds fly
let them hear your rage
show no fear
attack

charge your horses across the fields
together we ride into destiny
have no fear of death, when its your time
odin will bring us home, when we die

the ground trembles under us
as we make our thunder charge
the pounding hooves spread panic and fear into their hearts
our helmets shine in the sun as we near their wall of shields
some of them turn and run
when they hear our frenzied screams!

draw your swords to strike
hear the black birds cry
let them feel your hate
show no fear

charge your horses across the fields
together we ride into destiny
have no fear of death, when its our time
odin will bring us home, when we die

the enemy are in disarray, ride them down as they run
send them to their fallen graves, don't spare anyone
dead and wounded lie all around, see the pain in their eyes
over the field an eerie sound, as we hear the ravens cry"

my heart is breaking for and with you

but after all of what's between
you still chose yourself over me
my heart hurts and my heart breaks

not here where we leave our hearts
the illusion for your weakened love

this is not what we were made for
far from the compassion we have known
far from the love that we have shown

The Eleventh Hour|August Burns Red|metal|"we've heard the sound that ears bleed to hear
the sound of a place the entire universe awaits
here the strongest fall to their knees
a passion so powerful that walls crumble to their foundations
the lost find their way back home, but the masses buy what will make them rich, feasting on lies, chasing their tails
truth be told, they'll get what they were promised
crawling away, burning with regret, to the deepest, darkest depths of hell
we got news for you
the day is soon coming when turning your back won't be an option
keep telling yourself what you really don't believe
you can compromise what you know to be true, and you can turn off all of your senses, but in the end you'll see nothing stands between a man and his maker
no matter what it's your decision
this isn't something you could do alone
give up, give in no matter what, it's your decision"
Unsilent Storms In The North Abyss|Immortal|metal|"delight of the moon is burning inside

staring into a ground of glass

Electric Crown|Testament|metal|"

here we go, the people show
victims of tomorrow
the way it goes, it never shows
emptiness or sorrow
there is nothing left inside
nothing left to cry for
so i justify my crimes
things that i must die for



so alone, away it goes
the life that you have wasted
you never know where it might go
the sweet success you've tasted
tested by a bitter frown
knowing i must die for
can't confide to all the lies
no one to inquire

as i wander, change of seasons
as i realise that i'll soon be there

i'll let you know, the reapers show
makes you beg or borrow
he comes to see the tragedy
his fate he will not follow
wearing your electric crown
the preacher starts to pray
shiver as the lights go down
heed these words i say

as i wander, change of seasons
i can't ponder, got my reasons
as i realise i don't care
all i know is that i'll soon be there



now it's done, the time has come
the people stand in silence
another dawn has come and gone
his fate has been decided
there is no one left inside
a brain without mind
traces of a bitter man
are all that you will find

as i wander, change of seasons
i can't ponder, got my reasons

all i know is, that i'll soon be there

feeding the demon seed, evil bestowed on me

oblivious to evil

on soundless magic wings

words meant to build walls around your skin
to restrain the powers kept within

converted you were told to find the way
to reach the land of everyday

penetrated soul weakened and misled
beholder of a life that perish
soon you'll wake up dead
a lie have built unto itself
a throne in your head
beholder of a life that perished
you are living dead!

defiled the cross hanging around
your neck
with blood from never concluded lives
the symbol of spiritual lobotomy tells you're
a slave to repeated lies

i can see right through you will
cease to exist
and fade away - into your minds wasteland -
i live while you decay

i gaze into your eyes
two wells of extinguished life
mental winter living lie
you're searching the long lost and long to die
illuminate your inner shadows the darkness
kept from light
you walk one way but your heads on backwards
and end up being what you fight"

nearer have i never been
to this that i always searched
the crystal cleared opening
in wich i shall be gone

infernally vasts take my sight again
the light is dim before me
for the vision was frost

chiming bells of immortality

Suicide Season|Bring Me The Horizon|metal|"
we stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
the days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
the day you lost him, i slowly lost you too
for when he died, he took a part of you


no time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
no explanations, no fucking reasons why
i watched it eat you up, pieces falling on the floor
we stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore

i would climb my way to heaven and bring him back home again
don't give up hope, my friend

death is only a horizon, and i'm ready for the sun
i'm ready for the sun to, i'm ready for the sun to set

Together as One|Death|metal|"
labelled a creation of evil
ridiculed for their shocking appearance


sharing both pleasure and pain
two minds, two hearts, one soul


separating mentally
an illusion of privacy


together - they absorb each other's lives
as one - they will live and they will die
a living hell has begun


displayed as a nightmare
criticized through words and eyes
as they stare

to the normal it seems grotesque
connected by a, a bond of flesh


sharing both pleasure and pain
two minds, two hearts, one soul


separating mentally
an illusion of privacy


together - they absorb each other's lives
as one - they will live and they will die
a living hell has begun"
Breaking Point|Parkway Drive|metal|"black plagues line a fading sky
a dying world stripped to the bone
intoxicated by the madness

consumed, now chaos reigns
our pride dissolved
the rise and fall
the breaking point
burned and crossed

lost

now immune to all the carnage
we turn upon ourselves
within these times of desperation
we are the virus that has infected to its last

nothing is sacred
nothing shall be saved
no one shall be spared the horror
that has yet to come

destroy and discard
this is all that we know

blackened flesh, blistered
hangs from skeletal frames
stalking this arid wasteland
our minds immune to change

the shreds of morality
fall by the wayside
as we are left to ponder
these black box revelations

in the days to come
in this, our final hour
we will witness the true depths to which
humanity can sink

humanity can sink

we will learn
learn to suffer
we will learn
learn to fail
and before long, before long
we will beg for the end

and still the fires rage
consumed, now chaos reigns
our pride dissolved

The Axe|Gojira|metal|"
i've been a victim to the blade against myself
bloodletting all of my soul
sucked in, paralyzed in this vortex
reduced to silence
in the dark, i've lingered too long
this sharpened axe, beam of light
i reach for, and i master
wield against these shadows


its purpose now revealed in silence
keep searching, question if this light ends


now i will strike and dig with precision
introspective eye, erase the concept
i lost my fears and the notion of time
i healed my sorrow
all boundaries are illusion
when you reach the centre light and
reinforce the striking power
by chance you're followed


its purpose now revealed in silence
keep searching, question if this light ends

i see them all, release their shadow"

awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittence


the sky is turning red
return to power draws near
fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone


pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away


raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now i shall reign in blood

hiding behind the empty smiles
so simple (the anguish)

crawling back into the dark

the shadows i cast
follow me down


deeper i'm falling
into the arms of sorrow
blindly descending

the sound of beating winds

at war with reality

the air it hangs dying
dressed in the nightmares of old

Cosmic Keys To My Creations And Times|Emperor|metal|"the heavens are lit by the stars
where years of secrets of universal forces lay hid
they shine so bright, but yet
they have seen more evil than time itself
reflected in the deepless lakes

they are the planetary keys to unlimited wisdom
and power for the emperor to obtain
(they) being the gods of the wolves
whom upon they bark at night

requesting their next victim in thirst of blood
i enjoy those moments i may haunt with these beasts of the night

what kinds of beings are existing at the deeps of my lakes?
they surely must be of an evil race
for no friendly thing can live
in such depressive waters

(here is also a planet similar to the moon, but its phases is only one
and it is in its most powerful for all and ever...
there passes no light without the barking of the wolves.)

all these landscapes are timeless
and this is all just a part of cosmos
(but) all is mine and past and future is yet to discover...
much have been discovered, but tomorrow
i will realise i existed before myself

i will be reborn
before i die

i will realise planets ages old
created by a ruler with a crown of dragon claws
arrived with a stargate...
a king among the wolves in the night...
an observer of the stars

Born Dead|Death|metal|"
brought to this world to wither away
naive about the ways of life is what they say
millions live millions die, more are yet to come
living skeletons - where they come from


born dead into this world
to starve and rot in agony
born dead into this world
it's their choice, why can't you see


life of misery
soon a corpse you be
as bones show through
nothing you can do


relief does not exist
when you are born to die


disease spreads fast across their dying world
many cemeteries they will have to build
as process goes on for many years to come
a human waste land created when they are done

Tears of the Dragon|Bruce Dickinson|metal|"


for too long now
there were secrets in my mind
for too long now
there were things i should have said


in the darkness
i was stumbling for the door
to find a reason
to find the time, the place...the hour


waiting for the winter sun
and the cold light of day
the misty ghosts of childhood fears
the pressure is building
and i can't stay away


i throw myself into the sea
release the wave, let it wash over me
to face the fear i once believed
the tears of the dragon
for you and for me


where i was
i had wings that couldn't fly
where i was
i had tears i couldn't cry


my emotions
frozen in an icy lake
i couldn't feel them
until the ice began to break


i have no power over this
you know i'm afraid
the walls i built are crumbling away
the water is moving, i'm slipping away


i throw myself into the sea
release the wave, let it wash over me
to face the fear i once believed
the tears of the dragon
for you and for me



slowly i awake
slowly i rise
the walls i built are crumbling away
the water is moving, i'm slipping away


i throw myself into the sea
release the wave, let it wash over me
to face the fear i once believed

i've tried for so very long
i'd die to become immortal
that's why i sing this song
am i a wannabe? have i no dignity?
who'd give up all my life to be
in the book of heavy metal...metal!
in the book of heavy metal

in life, i have no religion
besides the heavy metal gods
wear nothing but black skin tight leather
my skin's clad with metal studs
am i a wannabe? have i no dignity?
i give up all my life to be
in the book of heavy metal...metal!
in the book of heavy metal

some twenty years ago, the goods put down their feet
so firmly in to the ground that no man of sword nor pen
could ever change the rules upon which
the very fundament of metal was made

read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
read all about it, in the manual
read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
read all about it, yes, read it!

don't need no flashy house, no car or ugly wife
the only thing i want is what my parents daunt
need no widescreen tv
no, in all honesty
the only thing i want to be (to be or not to be)

in the book of heavy metal - metal!
in the book of heavy metal - metal!

in the book of heavy metal - in life - metal!
in the book of heavy metal - to death - metal!

i've signed a contract with the devil
i'd like to become a star
i'd die to become immortal
that's why i play the guitar"
Old Ghost / New Regrets|Parkway Drive|metal|"forever fucked!
we've waged a war of suffering and deceit
one hundred thousand years of dreaming, drowned in a flood of fear and greed
precious heritage, laid waste before the chainsaw's snarling teeth
bleed the earth, bleed her till her heart no longer beats
and still we wonder why
as the ground beneath our feet turns to dust
the air we breathe laced with poisons
a legacy of disgust, a legacy of sorrow

so we're born with nothing and we die alone

we're born with nothing and we die alone
regret is all we have, death is all we know
x2

forever fucked!
eradicate the truths of history
train our eyes, train our minds so we no longer see the casualties
countless cultures murdered, generations stolen and deceived
no guilt to bear, born to consume, to breed, to deny all that makes us free

we're born with nothing and we die alone. x2
we're born with nothing - we die alone
we're born with nothing and we die alone
we're born with nothing - we die alone
we die alone

forever fucked!
we're born with nothing and we die alone
we're born with nothing - we die alone"
Battery|Metallica|metal|"
lashing out the action, returning the reaction
weak are ripped and torn away
hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
battery is here to stay


smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery has found in me

crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
never-ending potency
hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
breeding on insanity


smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me

pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery

circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
powerhouse of energy
whipping up a fury, dominating flurry

Drink|Alestorm|metal|"
oi you, gizz a beer


piracy's a crime and crime doesn't pay
and we go home poor at the end of the day
but i'd rather live my life in rags
than be chained to a desk with a wife that's a hag
we live each day like there's nothing to lose
but a man has needs and that need is booze
they say all the best things in life are free
so give all your beer and your rum to me


we are here to drink your beer
and steal your rum at the point of a gun
your alcohol to us will fall
'cause we are here to drink your beer

(drink, drink, drink, drink, drink)
(drink, drink, drink, drink, drink)


we sailed o'er seas for wenches and mead
and told great tales of the huntmaster's deeds
the quest for a drop of the famous ol' spiced
has shown us the wrath of leviathan's bites
we went back through time to get more rum
though we end up shipwrecked having no fun
but heavy metal pirates we must be
so give all your beer and your rum to me


we are here to drink your beer
and steal your rum at the point of a gun
your alcohol to us will fall
'cause we are here to drink your beer

And the Snakes Start to Sing|Bring Me The Horizon|metal|"

With Strength I Burn|Emperor|metal|"deep green dark chaos
blinded i run down these paths
by heart i know them
they lead to the soaring cliffs
stout they stand above the water's edge
lifeless

and this is my foundation
cold stone
formed only by winds and time
how invulnerable
lifeless

ahh...
i have longed to be at one with this
yet, the waters call my name

for once i wish to see
the entity behind the voice
the face of this seduction
the beauty of my pain

am i blessed or am i cursed by thy presence?
what is my crime?
what is my deed?
is this life my redemption?
shall i repent or proceed?

i hate my flesh
its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
it made me question the essence of...
the 'i'

slaves are those of this world
given freedom to lay the chains upon the master
the wolf is no longer free
release the chains and come for me

suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned
out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships
sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. yet, the
crew they bore... three times twelve in numbers. they
stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns
and from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting
bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted
and away they sailed...

upon these seas
wherein i drowned so many times
i scatter the ashes of destiny
still my flame is in hunger

with fire in my heart
shall i greet the shores ahead
though, i know not what will burn...

desire...

ahh...
in the distance
i hear the waves wash over solid ground
and in this moment i am struck blind

grant me sight so i can see
that which lies ahead of me
cursed be my mortal eyes
for dying in this realm of death

hear my call...

i return to the soaring cliffs
they truly shine of strength
even though i nothing learned
with strength i burn..."
Visions in My Head|Obituary|metal|"

turn away and slam the door
i don’t care what they’re going to say
let the storm rage on
the cold never bothered me anyway

it’s funny how some distance
makes everything seems small
and the fears that once controlled me
can’t get to me at all

up here in the cold thin air i finally can breathe
i know i’ve left a life behind but i’m too relieved to grieve!

it’s time to see what i can do
to test the limits and break through
no right, no wrong, no rules for me
i’m free

let it go, let it go
i am one with the wind and sky
let it go, let it go
you’ll never see me cry
here i stand and here i’ll stay
let the storm rage on…

my power flurries through the air into the ground
my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
i’m never going back
the past is in the past

let it go, let it go
and i’ll rise like the break of dawn
let it go, let it go
that perfect boy is gone
here i stand in the light of day
let the storm rage on
the cold never bothered me anyway!"

only known to the mother in guilt, as she stumbles from the alley covered in flies

sucks the crack pipe in shame just to forget
yet with another hit, she's on the streets again

tossing the carcass, in the waste bin death legally designed?
or fixing the future with quick extraction?

aborted removal, with cold precision
tools specifically designed forcing fetal termination

hatching living ghosts
pregnant, drunk and high

psychopath, maternity-mad

where dragon ships had sailed to sea
more times than one could say

to see with own eyes the wonder
people told, from man to man
the god of all almightiness
had arrived from a foreign land

the rumors told of a man
who had come from the other side the seas
carrying gold cross around neck in chain
and spoke in strange tongue of peace

he had come with strange men in armor
dressed in purple shirts and lace
smelling not of beer but flowers
and with no hair in face

and the bold man carrying cross
had told all one of asa bay
the god of all man, woman, child had come
to them all save

and to thank lord of heaven
one should build to god a house
and to save one's soul from hell
one should be baptized and say vows

a man of pride with the hammer told new god
to build his house on own
and spoke loud of the gods of their fathers
not too long time gone

the rumors said the man with a beard like fire
and the hammer in chain
by men in armor silenced was and by
their swords was slain

those who did not pay the one coin
of four to man of new god
whipped was twenty and put in chains then locked
by their neck to the log, to the log

and so all of asa bay did build
a house of the cross
every hour of daylight they did sweat
limbs ached because faith does cost

and on the day two hundred
there it stood white to the sky
the house of the god of the cross
big enough to take two dragon ships inside

and all of asa bay did watch
the wonder raise to the sky
now must the god of the cross be pleased
and satisfied

just outside the circle of the crowd
one old man did stand
he looked across the waters

and his old eyes could almost see
the dragon ships set sail
and his old ears could almost hear
men of great numbers call out oden's hail

and though he did know already
though he turned face towards sky

spoken only way up high

now this house of a foreign god does stand
now must they leave us alone
still he heard from somewhere in the woods
old crow of wisdom say
""people of asa land, it's only just begun"""

but everything to die for

lost all will to keep trying
our beds we must lie in

so why was i born
not a part of this society?

i tried so hard to reach for the stars but i failed you all

never had a real chance at all

time marches onwards and nothing can ever be the same

what is it that you need to see
to finally believe this is who i'm supposed to be?

what will be written on your tombstone?

hollow shell such as yourself?
would you prefer that i give up my dreams
and lose all hope just like everyone else?

embrace the beast and shun the weak
awake the primal one that sleeps inside
or feel the shiv(er) running through your spine


the time is slipping by no peace in sight
but the teeth of time still hold their bite


my hands are painted red
my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else
my hands are painted red
my hands are painted red


schizophrenic amnesia
bid goodbye to all you knew and loved
forget the only life that you knew outside
they bought the ticket, now you take the ride


the time is slipping by no peace in sight
but the teeth of time still hold their bite


my hands are painted red
my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else
my hands are painted red
my hands are painted red


another number quickly learns the rules
a hidden burner waits to point at you
a subtle gesture and you're ventilated
talk isn't cheap here, bleed out in payment


six bars laid across the sky
four empty walls to fill the time


my hands are painted red
my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else
my hands are painted red
my hands are painted red

my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else

but he also was the kind of teacher

it was a shame how he carried on

he ruled the russian land and never mind the tsar
but the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
in all affairs of state he was the man to please
but he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
for the queen he was no wheeler dealer
though she'd heard the things he'd done
she believed he was a holy healer
who would heal her son

there was a cat that really was gone

but when he's drinking and lusting
and hungers of power become known to more and more people
their demands to do something about this outrageous man
grew louder and louder

""hey hey""

""this man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies
but the ladies begged ""don't you try to do it, please""
no doubt this rasputin had lots of hidden charms
though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
then one night some men of higher standing
set a trap, they're not to blame
""come to visit us"" they kept demanding
and he really came

they put some poison into his wine

the fading of love, life and light

wandering an endless journey

Deme Quaden Thyrane|Marduk|metal|"on a cold mist october morning
in the year of the lord 1462
the horses appeared on the hills of brasov
the process of damnation would soon begun

dracul would show the world how to correct
the rumanians which lacked strength or showed disrespect
the following story is just one of many on draculs way
to outwipe every opposer who didn't him blindly obey

he killed by crushing them under the wheels of barrows
others were undressed and skinned alive
to their very bowels and others were still impaled upon wooden poles
or fried over the glowing embers placed under them

the cold wind of death follow in his way
deme quaden thyrane

some of them were run through with stakes that impaled their heads, breasts
and behind
until the pole was driven through the mouth
to ellude the lack of any cruelty he drew stakes through
the breast of mothers and then he went on by impaling
their infants upon theese ?

the cold wind of death follows in his way
deme quaden thyrane

so many have to die
by the horrible ways of torturing them
with such instruments that can only be invented
by the most nefarious cruelty possessed
uttermost dreadful tyrant that ever existed

but the hungarian king mathias corvinus now dracul betrayed
and for twelve long years vlad now in the kings prison stayed
but the bonds of blood that dracul in prison tied
made his king in wallachia again with mathias as an allied
with lord stefan bathori's army and military skill
dracul now will make all saches, boyars, danesti's and turks blood chill"

Revel In Flesh|Entombed|metal|"as your eyes are filled with horror
i lift up the corpse on the bench
you can't avoid the dismal sight
its arms and legs i retrench

excavating its interior
to get ahold of what's inside
and as i drivel and belch
you feel so damn reviled

i continue with laugther
i drink the bowel's rheum
squeezing my hand through its mouth and further
through its stomach to its womb

of its once called body
there seems nothing to be left
and you better prepare yourself
for an equaling death

revel in flesh

pools of coagulated blood
and rotten flesh by my side
now i really need something more
to kill another day in my life"

A Fine Day To Die|Bathory|metal|"orgy of silence
conspiracy of peace
only the sound
of the cold northern breeze

behind the black lake
asleep is the mountains
yet the night is awake

strange is the night
now black stars rise
and many moons circle
through silent the night

along the black mountainside scattered
by the campfires awaiting the dawn
two times a hundred men in battles
tried by the steel in the arrow, axe, and the sword

by battle worn hunger torn awaitening
for the sun to break through the cold haze
and for the banners of ebal to appear
on the hill in the suns first warm rays

the elder among the men looked deep into
the fire and spoke loud with pride
tomorrow is a fine day to die

now the sun breaks through dustclouds and haze
now a forest of spears appears on the hill

When Life Has Ceased|Entombed|metal|"the interval before the marriage

        although the enchanted house was no more, and the working world had broken into it, and was hammering and crashing and tramping up and down stairs all day long keeping diogenes in an incessant paroxysm of barking, from sunrise to sunset—evidently convinced that his enemy had got the better of him at last, and was then sacking the premises in triumphant defiance—there was, at first, no other great change in the method of florence's life. at night, when the workpeople went away, the house was dreary and deserted again; and florence, listening to their voices echoing through the hall and staircase as they departed, pictured to herself the cheerful homes to which the were returning, and the children who were waiting for them, and was glad to think that they were merry and well pleased to go.

        she welcomed back the evening silence as an old friend, but it came now with an altered face, and looked more kindly on her. fresh hope was in it. the beautiful lady who had soothed and carressed her, in the very room in which her heart had been so wrung, was a spirit of promise to her. soft shadows of the bright life dawning, when her father's affection should be gradually won, and all, or much should be restored, of what she had lost on the dark day when a mother's love had faded with a mother's last breath on her cheek, moved about her in the twilight and were welcome company. peeping at the rosy children her neighbours, it was a new and precious sensation to think that they might soon speak together and know each other; when she would not fear, as of old, to show herself before them, lest they should be grieved to see her in her black dress sitting there alone!

        in her thoughts of her new mother, and in the love and trust overflowing her pure heart towards her, florence loved her own dead mother more and more. she had no fear of setting up a rival in her breast. the new flower sprang from the deep-planted and long-cherished root, she knew. every gentle word that had fallen from the lips of the beautiful lady, sounded to florence like an echo of the voice long hushed and silent. how could she love that memory less for living tenderness, when it was her memory of all parental tenderness and love!

        florence was, one day, sitting reading in her room, and thinking of the lady and her promised visit soon—for her book turned on a kindred subject—when, raising her eyes, she saw her standing in the doorway.

        'mama!' cried florence, joyfully meeting her. 'come again!'

        'not mama yet,' returned the lady, with a serious smile, as she encircled florence's neck with her arm.

        'but very soon to be,' cried florence.

        'very soon now, florence: very soon.'

        edith bent her head a little, so as to press the blooming cheek of florence against her own, and for some few moments remained thus silent. there was something so very tender in her manner, that florence was even more sensible of it than on the first occasion of their meeting.

        she led florence to a chair beside her, and sat down: florence looking in her face, quite wondering at its beauty, and willingly leaving her hand in hers.

        'have you been alone, florence, since i was here last?'

        'oh yes!' smiled florence, hastily.

        she hesitated and cast down her eyes; for her new mama was very earnest in her look, and the look was intently and thoughtfully fixed upon her face.

        'i—i—am used to be alone,' said florence. 'i don't mind it at all. di and i pass whole days together, sometimes.' florence might have said, whole weeks and months.

        'is di your maid, love?'

        'my dog, mama,' said florence, laughing. 'susan is my maid.'

        'and these are your rooms,' said edith, looking round. 'i was not shown these rooms the other day. we must have them improved, florence. they shall be made the prettiest in the house.'

        'if i might change them, mama,' returned florence; 'there is one upstairs i should like much better.'

        'is this not high enough, dear girl?' asked edith, smiling.

        'the other was my brother's room,' said florence, 'and i am very fond of it. i would have spoken to papa about it when i came home, and found the workmen here, and everything changing; but—'

        florence dropped her eyes, lest the same look should make her falter again.

        'but i was afraid it might distress him; and as you said you would be here again soon, mama, and are the mistress of everything, i determined to take courage and ask you.'

        edith sat looking at her, with her brilliant eyes intent upon her face, until florence raising her own, she, in her turn, withdrew her gaze, and turned it on the ground. it was then that florence thought how different this lady's beauty was, from what she had supposed. she had thought it of a proud and lofty kind; yet her manner was so subdued and gentle, that if she had been of florence's own age and character, it scarcely could have invited confidence more.

        except when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her; and then she seemed (but florence hardly understood this, though she could not choose but notice it, and think about it) as if she were humbled before florence, and ill at ease. when she had said that she was not her mama yet, and when florence had called her the mistress of everything there, this change in her was quick and startling; and now, while the eyes of florence rested on her face, she sat as though she would have shrunk and hidden from her, rather than as one about to love and cherish her, in right of such a near connexion.

        she gave florence her ready promise, about her new room, and said she would give directions about it herself. she then asked some questions concerning poor paul; and when they had sat in conversation for some time, told florence she had come to take her to her own home.

        'we have come to london now, my mother and i,' said edith, 'and you shall stay with us until i am married. i wish that we should know and trust each other, florence.'

        'you are very kind to me,' said florence, 'dear mama. how much i thank you!'

        'let me say now, for it may be the best opportunity,' continued edith, looking round to see that they were quite alone, and speaking in a lower voice, 'that when i am married, and have gone away for some weeks, i shall be easier at heart if you will come home here. no matter who invites you to stay elsewhere. come home here. it is better to be alone than—what i would say is,' she added, checking herself, 'that i know well you are best at home, dear florence.'

        'i will come home on the very day, mama'

        'do so. i rely on that promise. now, prepare to come with me, dear girl. you will find me downstairs when you are ready.'

        slowly and thoughtfully did edith wander alone through the mansion of which she was so soon to be the lady: and little heed took she of all the elegance and splendour it began to display. the same indomitable haughtiness of soul, the same proud scorn expressed in eye and lip, the same fierce beauty, only tamed by a sense of its own little worth, and of the little worth of everything around it, went through the grand saloons and halls, that had got loose among the shady trees, and raged and rent themselves. the mimic roses on the walls and floors were set round with sharp thorns, that tore her breast; in every scrap of gold so dazzling to the eye, she saw some hateful atom of her purchase-money; the broad high mirrors showed her, at full length, a woman with a noble quality yet dwelling in her nature, who was too false to her better self, and too debased and lost, to save herself. she believed that all this was so plain, more or less, to all eyes, that she had no resource or power of self-assertion but in pride: and with this pride, which tortured her own heart night and day, she fought her fate out, braved it, and defied it.

        was this the woman whom florence—an innocent girl, strong only in her earnestness and simple truth—could so impress and quell, that by her side she was another creature, with her tempest of passion hushed, and her very pride itself subdued? was this the woman who now sat beside her in a carriage, with her arms entwined, and who, while she courted and entreated her to love and trust her, drew her fair head to nestle on her breast, and would have laid down life to shield it from wrong or harm?

        oh, edith! it were well to die, indeed, at such a time! better and happier far, perhaps, to die so, edith, than to live on to the end!

        the honourable mrs skewton, who was thinking of anything rather than of such sentiments—for, like many genteel persons who have existed at various times, she set her face against death altogether, and objected to the mention of any such low and levelling upstart—had borrowed a house in brook street, grosvenor square, from a stately relative (one of the feenix brood), who was out of town, and who did not object to lending it, in the handsomest manner, for nuptial purposes, as the loan implied his final release and acquittance from all further loans and gifts to mrs skewton and her daughter. it being necessary for the credit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time, mrs skewton, with the assistance of an accommodating tradesman resident in the parish of mary-le-bone, who lent out all sorts of articles to the nobility and gentry, from a service of plate to an army of footmen, clapped into this house a silver-headed butler (who was charged extra on that account, as having the appearance of an ancient family retainer), two very tall young men in livery, and a select staff of kitchen-servants; so that a legend arose, downstairs, that withers the page, released at once from his numerous household duties, and from the propulsion of the wheeled-chair (inconsistent with the metropolis), had been several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs, as if he misdoubted his having overslept himself at the leamington milkman's, and being still in a celestial dream. a variety of requisites in plate and china being also conveyed to the same establishment from the same convenient source, with several miscellaneous articles, including a neat chariot and a pair of bays, mrs skewton cushioned herself on the principal sofa, in the cleopatra attitude, and held her court in fair state.

        'and how,' said mrs skewton, on the entrance of her daughter and her charge, 'is my charming florence? you must come and kiss me, florence, if you please, my love.'

        florence was timidly stooping to pick out a place in the white part of mrs skewton's face, when that lady presented her ear, and relieved her of her difficulty.

        'edith, my dear,' said mrs skewton, 'positively, i—stand a little more in the light, my sweetest florence, for a moment.'

        florence blushingly complied.

        'you don't remember, dearest edith,' said her mother, 'what you were when you were about the same age as our exceedingly precious florence, or a few years younger?'

        'i have long forgotten, mother.'

        'for positively, my dear,' said mrs skewton, 'i do think that i see a decided resemblance to what you were then, in our extremely fascinating young friend. and it shows,' said mrs skewton, in a lower voice, which conveyed her opinion that florence was in a very unfinished state, 'what cultivation will do.'

        'it does, indeed,' was edith's stern reply.

        her mother eyed her sharply for a moment, and feeling herself on unsafe ground, said, as a diversion:

        'my charming florence, you must come and kiss me once more, if you please, my love.'

        florence complied, of course, and again imprinted her lips on mrs skewton's ear.

        'and you have heard, no doubt, my darling pet,' said mrs skewton, detaining her hand, 'that your papa, whom we all perfectly adore and dote upon, is to be married to my dearest edith this day week.'

        'i knew it would be very soon,' returned florence, 'but not exactly when.'

        'my darling edith,' urged her mother, gaily, 'is it possible you have not told florence?'

        'why should i tell florence?' she returned, so suddenly and harshly, that florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice.

        mrs skewton then told florence, as another and safer diversion, that her father was coming to dinner, and that he would no doubt be charmingly surprised to see her; as he had spoken last night of dressing in the city, and had known nothing of edith's design, the execution of which, according to mrs skewton's expectation, would throw him into a perfect ecstasy. florence was troubled to hear this; and her distress became so keen, as the dinner-hour approached, that if she had known how to frame an entreaty to be suffered to return home, without involving her father in her explanation, she would have hurried back on foot, bareheaded, breathless, and alone, rather than incur the risk of meeting his displeasure.

        as the time drew nearer, she could hardly breathe. she dared not approach a window, lest he should see her from the street. she dared not go upstairs to hide her emotion, lest, in passing out at the door, she should meet him unexpectedly; besides which dread, she felt as though she never could come back again if she were summoned to his presence. in this conflict of fears; she was sitting by cleopatra's couch, endeavouring to understand and to reply to the bald discourse of that lady, when she heard his foot upon the stair.

        'i hear him now!' cried florence, starting. 'he is coming!'

        cleopatra, who in her juvenility was always playfully disposed, and who in her self-engrossment did not trouble herself about the nature of this agitation, pushed florence behind her couch, and dropped a shawl over her, preparatory to giving mr dombey a rapture of surprise. it was so quickly done, that in a moment florence heard his awful step in the room.

        he saluted his intended mother-in-law, and his intended bride. the strange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his child.

        'my dear dombey,' said cleopatra, 'come here and tell me how your pretty florence is.'

        'florence is very well,' said mr dombey, advancing towards the couch.

        'at home?'

        'at home,' said mr dombey.

        'my dear dombey,' returned cleopatra, with bewitching vivacity; 'now are you sure you are not deceiving me? i don't know what my dearest edith will say to me when i make such a declaration, but upon my honour i am afraid you are the falsest of men, my dear dombey.'

        though he had been; and had been detected on the spot, in the most enormous falsehood that was ever said or done; he could hardly have been more disconcerted than he was, when mrs skewton plucked the shawl away, and florence, pale and trembling, rose before him like a ghost. he had not yet recovered his presence of mind, when florence had run up to him, clasped her hands round his neck, kissed his face, and hurried out of the room. he looked round as if to refer the matter to somebody else, but edith had gone after florence, instantly.

        'now, confess, my dear dombey,' said mrs skewton, giving him her hand, 'that you never were more surprised and pleased in your life.'

        'i never was more surprised,' said mr dombey.

        'nor pleased, my dearest dombey?' returned mrs skewton, holding up her fan.

        'i—yes, i am exceedingly glad to meet florence here,' said mr dombey. he appeared to consider gravely about it for a moment, and then said, more decidedly, 'yes, i really am very glad indeed to meet florence here.'

        'you wonder how she comes here?' said mrs skewton, 'don't you?'

        'edith, perhaps—' suggested mr dombey.

        'ah! wicked guesser!' replied cleopatra, shaking her head. 'ah! cunning, cunning man! one shouldn't tell these things; your sex, my dear dombey, are so vain, and so apt to abuse our weakness; but you know my open soul—very well; immediately.'

        this was addressed to one of the very tall young men who announced dinner.

        'but edith, my dear dombey,' she continued in a whisper, 'when she cannot have you near her—and as i tell her, she cannot expect that always—will at least have near her something or somebody belonging to you. well, how extremely natural that is! and in this spirit, nothing would keep her from riding off to-day to fetch our darling florence. well, how excessively charming that is!'

        as she waited for an answer, mr dombey answered, 'eminently so.'

        'bless you, my dear dombey, for that proof of heart!' cried cleopatra, squeezing his hand. 'but i am growing too serious! take me downstairs, like an angel, and let us see what these people intend to give us for dinner. bless you, dear dombey!'

        cleopatra skipping off her couch with tolerable briskness, after the last benediction, mr dombey took her arm in his and led her ceremoniously downstairs; one of the very tall young men on hire, whose organ of veneration was imperfectly developed, thrusting his tongue into his cheek, for the entertainment of the other very tall young man on hire, as the couple turned into the dining-room.

        florence and edith were already there, and sitting side by side. florence would have risen when her father entered, to resign her chair to him; but edith openly put her hand upon her arm, and mr dombey took an opposite place at the round table.

        the conversation was almost entirely sustained by mrs skewton. florence hardly dared to raise her eyes, lest they should reveal the traces of tears; far less dared to speak; and edith never uttered one word, unless in answer to a question. verily, cleopatra worked hard, for the establishment that was so nearly clutched; and verily it should have been a rich one to reward her!

        'and so your preparations are nearly finished at last, my dear dombey?' said cleopatra, when the dessert was put upon the table, and the silver-headed butler had withdrawn. 'even the lawyers' preparations!'

        'yes, madam,' replied mr dombey; 'the deed of settlement, the professional gentlemen inform me, is now ready, and as i was mentioning to you, edith has only to do us the favour to suggest her own time for its execution.'

        edith sat like a handsome statue; as cold, as silent, and as still.

        'my dearest love,' said cleopatra, 'do you hear what mr dombey says? ah, my dear dombey!' aside to that gentleman, 'how her absence, as the time approaches, reminds me of the days, when that most agreeable of creatures, her papa, was in your situation!'

        'i have nothing to suggest. it shall be when you please,' said edith, scarcely looking over the table at mr dombey.

        'to-morrow?' suggested mr dombey.

        'if you please.'

        'or would next day,' said mr dombey, 'suit your engagements better?'

        'i have no engagements. i am always at your disposal. let it be when you like.'

        'no engagements, my dear edith!' remonstrated her mother, 'when you are in a most terrible state of flurry all day long, and have a thousand and one appointments with all sorts of trades-people!'

        'they are of your making,' returned edith, turning on her with a slight contraction of her brow. 'you and mr dombey can arrange between you.'

        'very true indeed, my love, and most considerate of you!' said cleopatra. 'my darling florence, you must really come and kiss me once more, if you please, my dear!'

        singular coincidence, that these gushes of interest in florence hurried cleopatra away from almost every dialogue in which edith had a share, however trifling! florence had certainly never undergone so much embracing, and perhaps had never been, unconsciously, so useful in her life.

        mr dombey was far from quarrelling, in his own breast, with the manner of his beautiful betrothed. he had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness, which is found in a fellow-feeling. it flattered him to think how these deferred to him, in edith's case, and seemed to have no will apart from his. it flattered him to picture to himself, this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house, and chilling his guests after his own manner. the dignity of dombey and son would be heightened and maintained, indeed, in such hands.

        so thought mr dombey, when he was left alone at the dining-table, and mused upon his past and future fortunes: finding no uncongeniality in an air of scant and gloomy state that pervaded the room, in colour a dark brown, with black hatchments of pictures blotching the walls, and twenty-four black chairs, with almost as many nails in them as so many coffins, waiting like mutes, upon the threshold of the turkey carpet; and two exhausted negroes holding up two withered branches of candelabra on the sideboard, and a musty smell prevailing as if the ashes of ten thousand dinners were entombed in the sarcophagus below it. the owner of the house lived much abroad; the air of england seldom agreed long with a member of the feenix family; and the room had gradually put itself into deeper and still deeper mourning for him, until it was become so funereal as to want nothing but a body in it to be quite complete.

        no bad representation of the body, for the nonce, in his unbending form, if not in his attitude, mr dombey looked down into the cold depths of the dead sea of mahogany on which the fruit dishes and decanters lay at anchor: as if the subjects of his thoughts were rising towards the surface one by one, and plunging down again. edith was there in all her majesty of brow and figure; and close to her came florence, with her timid head turned to him, as it had been, for an instant, when she left the room; and edith's eyes upon her, and edith's hand put out protectingly. a little figure in a low arm-chair came springing next into the light, and looked upon him wonderingly, with its bright eyes and its old-young face, gleaming as in the flickering of an evening fire. again came florence close upon it, and absorbed his whole attention. whether as a fore-doomed difficulty and disappointment to him; whether as a rival who had crossed him in his way, and might again; whether as his child, of whom, in his successful wooing, he could stoop to think as claiming, at such a time, to be no more estranged; or whether as a hint to him that the mere appearance of caring for his own blood should be maintained in his new relations; he best knew. indifferently well, perhaps, at best; for marriage company and marriage altars, and ambitious scenes—still blotted here and there with florence—always florence—turned up so fast, and so confusedly, that he rose, and went upstairs to escape them.

        it was quite late at night before candles were brought; for at present they made mrs skewton's head ache, she complained; and in the meantime florence and mrs skewton talked together (cleopatra being very anxious to keep her close to herself), or florence touched the piano softly for mrs skewton's delight; to make no mention of a few occasions in the course of the evening, when that affectionate lady was impelled to solicit another kiss, and which always happened after edith had said anything. they were not many, however, for edith sat apart by an open window during the whole time (in spite of her mother's fears that she would take cold), and remained there until mr dombey took leave. he was serenely gracious to florence when he did so; and florence went to bed in a room within edith's, so happy and hopeful, that she thought of her late self as if it were some other poor deserted girl who was to be pitied for her sorrow; and in her pity, sobbed herself to sleep.

        the week fled fast. there were drives to milliners, dressmakers, jewellers, lawyers, florists, pastry-cooks; and florence was always of the party. florence was to go to the wedding. florence was to cast off her mourning, and to wear a brilliant dress on the occasion. the milliner's intentions on the subject of this dress—the milliner was a frenchwoman, and greatly resembled mrs skewton—were so chaste and elegant, that mrs skewton bespoke one like it for herself. the milliner said it would become her to admiration, and that all the world would take her for the young lady's sister.

        the week fled faster. edith looked at nothing and cared for nothing. her rich dresses came home, and were tried on, and were loudly commended by mrs skewton and the milliners, and were put away without a word from her. mrs skewton made their plans for every day, and executed them. sometimes edith sat in the carriage when they went to make purchases; sometimes, when it was absolutely necessary, she went into the shops. but mrs skewton conducted the whole business, whatever it happened to be; and edith looked on as uninterested and with as much apparent indifference as if she had no concern in it. florence might perhaps have thought she was haughty and listless, but that she was never so to her. so florence quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out, and soon subdued it.

        the week fled faster. it had nearly winged its flight away. the last night of the week, the night before the marriage, was come. in the dark room—for mrs skewton's head was no better yet, though she expected to recover permanently to-morrow—were that lady, edith, and mr dombey. edith was at her open window looking out into the street; mr dombey and cleopatra were talking softly on the sofa. it was growing late; and florence, being fatigued, had gone to bed.

        'my dear dombey,' said cleopatra, 'you will leave me florence to-morrow, when you deprive me of my sweetest edith.'

        mr dombey said he would, with pleasure.

        'to have her about me, here, while you are both at paris, and to think at her age, i am assisting in the formation of her mind, my dear dombey,' said cleopatra, 'will be a perfect balm to me in the extremely shattered state to which i shall be reduced.'

        edith turned her head suddenly. her listless manner was exchanged, in a moment, to one of burning interest, and, unseen in the darkness, she attended closely to their conversation.

        mr dombey would be delighted to leave florence in such admirable guardianship.

        'my dear dombey,' returned cleopatra, 'a thousand thanks for your good opinion. i feared you were going, with malice aforethought, as the dreadful lawyers say—those horrid prosers!—to condemn me to utter solitude.'

        'why do me so great an injustice, my dear madam?' said mr dombey.

        'because my charming florence tells me so positively she must go home tomorrow, returned cleopatra, that i began to be afraid, my dearest dombey, you were quite a bashaw.'

        'i assure you, madam!' said mr dombey, 'i have laid no commands on florence; and if i had, there are no commands like your wish.'

        'my dear dombey,' replied cleopatra, what a courtier you are! though i'll not say so, either; for courtiers have no heart, and yours pervades your farming life and character. and are you really going so early, my dear dombey!'

        oh, indeed! it was late, and mr dombey feared he must.

        'is this a fact, or is it all a dream!' lisped cleopatra. 'can i believe, my dearest dombey, that you are coming back tomorrow morning to deprive me of my sweet companion; my own edith!'

        mr dombey, who was accustomed to take things literally, reminded mrs skewton that they were to meet first at the church.

        'the pang,' said mrs skewton, 'of consigning a child, even to you, my dear dombey, is one of the most excruciating imaginable, and combined with a naturally delicate constitution, and the extreme stupidity of the pastry-cook who has undertaken the breakfast, is almost too much for my poor strength. but i shall rally, my dear dombey, in the morning; do not fear for me, or be uneasy on my account. heaven bless you! my dearest edith!' she cried archly. 'somebody is going, pet.'

        edith, who had turned her head again towards the window, and whose interest in their conversation had ceased, rose up in her place, but made no advance towards him, and said nothing. mr dombey, with a lofty gallantry adapted to his dignity and the occasion, betook his creaking boots towards her, put her hand to his lips, said, 'tomorrow morning i shall have the happiness of claiming this hand as mrs dombey's,' and bowed himself solemnly out.

        mrs skewton rang for candles as soon as the house-door had closed upon him. with the candles appeared her maid, with the juvenile dress that was to delude the world to-morrow. the dress had savage retribution in it, as such dresses ever have, and made her infinitely older and more hideous than her greasy flannel gown. but mrs skewton tried it on with mincing satisfaction; smirked at her cadaverous self in the glass, as she thought of its killing effect upon the major; and suffering her maid to take it off again, and to prepare her for repose, tumbled into ruins like a house of painted cards.

        all this time, edith remained at the dark window looking out into the street. when she and her mother were at last left alone, she moved from it for the first time that evening, and came opposite to her. the yawning, shaking, peevish figure of the mother, with her eyes raised to confront the proud erect form of the daughter, whose glance of fire was bent downward upon her, had a conscious air upon it, that no levity or temper could conceal.

        'i am tired to death,' said she. 'you can't be trusted for a moment. you are worse than a child. child! no child would be half so obstinate and undutiful.'

        'listen to me, mother,' returned edith, passing these words by with a scorn that would not descend to trifle with them. 'you must remain alone here until i return.'

        'must remain alone here, edith, until you return!' repeated her mother.

        'or in that name upon which i shall call to-morrow to witness what i do, so falsely: and so shamefully, i swear i will refuse the hand of this man in the church. if i do not, may i fall dead upon the pavement!'

        the mother answered with a look of quick alarm, in no degree diminished by the look she met.

        'it is enough,' said edith, steadily, 'that we are what we are. i will have no youth and truth dragged down to my level. i will have no guileless nature undermined, corrupted, and perverted, to amuse the leisure of a world of mothers. you know my meaning. florence must go home.'

        'you are an idiot, edith,' cried her angry mother. 'do you expect there can ever be peace for you in that house, till she is married, and away?'

        'ask me, or ask yourself, if i ever expect peace in that house,' said her daughter, 'and you know the answer.'

        'and am i to be told to-night, after all my pains and labour, and when you are going, through me, to be rendered independent,' her mother almost shrieked in her passion, while her palsied head shook like a leaf, 'that there is corruption and contagion in me, and that i am not fit company for a girl! what are you, pray? what are you?'

        'i have put the question to myself,' said edith, ashy pale, and pointing to the window, 'more than once when i have been sitting there, and something in the faded likeness of my sex has wandered past outside; and god knows i have met with my reply. oh mother, mother, if you had but left me to my natural heart when i too was a girl—a younger girl than florence—how different i might have been!'

        sensible that any show of anger was useless here, her mother restrained herself, and fell a whimpering, and bewailed that she had lived too long, and that her only child had cast her off, and that duty towards parents was forgotten in these evil days, and that she had heard unnatural taunts, and cared for life no longer.

        'if one is to go on living through continual scenes like this,' she whined, 'i am sure it would be much better for me to think of some means of putting an end to my existence. oh! the idea of your being my daughter, edith, and addressing me in such a strain!'

        'between us, mother,' returned edith, mournfully, 'the time for mutual reproaches is past.'

        'then why do you revive it?' whimpered her mother. 'you know that you are lacerating me in the cruellest manner. you know how sensitive i am to unkindness. at such a moment, too, when i have so much to think of, and am naturally anxious to appear to the best advantage! i wonder at you, edith. to make your mother a fright upon your wedding-day!'

        edith bent the same fixed look upon her, as she sobbed and rubbed her eyes; and said in the same low steady voice, which had neither risen nor fallen since she first addressed her, 'i have said that florence must go home.'

        'let her go!' cried the afflicted and affrighted parent, hastily. 'i am sure i am willing she should go. what is the girl to me?'

        'she is so much to me, that rather than communicate, or suffer to be communicated to her, one grain of the evil that is in my breast, mother, i would renounce you, as i would (if you gave me cause) renounce him in the church to-morrow,' replied edith. 'leave her alone. she shall not, while i can interpose, be tampered with and tainted by the lessons i have learned. this is no hard condition on this bitter night.'

        'if you had proposed it in a filial manner, edith,' whined her mother, 'perhaps not; very likely not. but such extremely cutting words—'

        'they are past and at an end between us now,' said edith. 'take your own way, mother; share as you please in what you have gained; spend, enjoy, make much of it; and be as happy as you will. the object of our lives is won. henceforth let us wear it silently. my lips are closed upon the past from this hour. i forgive you your part in to-morrow's wickedness. may god forgive my own!'

        without a tremor in her voice, or frame, and passing onward with a foot that set itself upon the neck of every soft emotion, she bade her mother good-night, and repaired to her own room.

        but not to rest; for there was no rest in the tumult of her agitation when alone to and fro, and to and fro, and to and fro again, five hundred times, among the splendid preparations for her adornment on the morrow; with her dark hair shaken down, her dark eyes flashing with a raging light, her broad white bosom red with the cruel grasp of the relentless hand with which she spurned it from her, pacing up and down with an averted head, as if she would avoid the sight of her own fair person, and divorce herself from its companionship. thus, in the dead time of the night before her bridal, edith granger wrestled with her unquiet spirit, tearless, friendless, silent, proud, and uncomplaining.

        at length it happened that she touched the open door which led into the room where florence lay.

        she started, stopped, and looked in.

        a light was burning there, and showed her florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty, fast asleep. edith held her breath, and felt herself drawn on towards her.

        drawn nearer, nearer, nearer yet; at last, drawn so near, that stooping down, she pressed her lips to the gentle hand that lay outside the bed, and put it softly to her neck. its touch was like the prophet's rod of old upon the rock. her tears sprung forth beneath it, as she sunk upon her knees, and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side.

        thus edith granger passed the night before her bridal. thus the sun found her on her bridal morning."

Hospital for Souls|Bring Me The Horizon|metal|"
and then i found out how hard it is to really change
even hell can get comfy once you've settled in
i just wanted the numb inside me to leave
no matter how fucked you get
sorrow is there when you come back down
funny thing is, all i ever wanted i already had
there's glimpses of heaven in every day
in the friends i have, the music i make, with the love i feel
i just had to start again


the days are a deathwish
a witch hunt for an exit
i am powerless
the fragile, the broken
sit in circles and stay unspoken
we are powerless
because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
silent halls and nameless faces
i am powerless
everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die
i can't fear death, no longer, i've died a thousand times
why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
there's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell


throw me to the flames!
watch me burn
set my world ablaze!
watch me burn


how are we on a scale of one to ten?
could you tell me what you see?
do you wanna talk about it?
how does that make you feel?
have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
have you been skipping meals?
we're gonna try something new today
how does that make you feel?

Allegiance|Dimmu Borgir|metal|"
cuddled through a cold womb he was
pitch black and without sunshine rays
hell patiently awaiting him on blood spilled soil
a noble grief stirred heart, always ready to die


in sinister systematization, submission is golden
as an apprentice to violence, slaughter and bloodshed
he was like an object that is being processed
a force-fed destructor ready for abomination


the vast solitude in him witnessed it all
those self afflicting eyes
and their fear painted faces
made out of utter discipline, failure unacceptable
hosts to oblivion
exploring the darkest of places
stench of rotten flesh breathing down his neck


every day seemed like an endless night
when would he ever wake from this void
no other voice than his own will ever tell
what was real and where he had been
what he had done


did you bleed for the cause
like the rest of his men
did you capture the euphoria
how it was like to kill
such a necromantic force behind it all
they sure did battle till the end


but when came all the glory
and who got spared to carry his body
just pure death and too profound to be shared
was it all a fabricated vision in his memory
to serve the wastelands of insanity
at the front


life forever lost its innocence
never to see the light of day again
he pondered his last few steps
into the realms of death
with his hands bloodstained


courage and consistency
bravery and valor
honor and pride
for what was it all worth"

believe yourselves and look away from all that's right within you
leave all your worries at the door and drift away

my hollow heart has bled me dry, left me to stray

without a trace

realize the pain we live in
demonize the need we reel in
no, in my memories i'll dig deep enough to know
centuries of dreams unending
another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed

no time should ever go to waste, it’s not that complicated
you’re free to live your life at ease, no more restraints
no heed for shadows on your way that try to steal your laughter
your light will drive them all away, be confident

will i refrain?
can i repent?
will you be there?
erase the page for i’m alone and ailing

and it can't break me down
go - i will decide
who can come in
and heal my disease
burn it - in flames
kill it - and maim
why can't you see that you need to be freed

intertwine the lines beneath the dark
every bit of pain we're feeling
every other solemn life
no, in the memories you will find somehow
there used to be a dream unending
no more need to be alone

demonize the need we reel in

as the sky goes from dark to black
ice cold whispers burns my skin
from nowhere to the deepest of my soul they speak unto me...
grievance of sadness, like the gift of sorrow
a moon, a bloodred full moon lights my black heart's night

lightning cracks the sky and thunders roll
through the night a chaos of storms arise

purgatory
burning flames catch my eyes
into the shadows (so dark) i hear the choirs of evil
a ""joy"" in blasphemy beyond my darkest fantasies

the gate is open...

into the silent shadows i crawl
upon the throne so cold
atmosphere of melancholy
i will forever burn...
burn... burn...

i'm drifting away with the wind, i go


i am hunting high and low
diving from the sky above
looking for more and more once again

carving a giant
carving the eye of a god

torn so much
taint a love
chasing a giant
forcing the wakes of a storm

standing as human
facing a god
fighting and turning your secrets

and every night i am the flame
and every night there is a fire

Hollow|Parkway Drive|metal|"lies!

my truth has been revealed
at the cost of everything i knew
my last safe-haven falls behind me
with the self that once consumed

into the void
i'm pursuing only answers
i'm shedding skins and faces
past loves and bitter hatreds

and it has come to pass
a path set in stone now breaks like glass
the failings of yesterday
become the catalyst to seek my change

and it has come to pass
a path set in stone now breaks like glass
the failings of yesterday become my catalyst

so here i stand, a stranger to my new-found freedom
i am a vessel
i am a vessel without destination, devoid of direction

no roles define me, yet conflict embraces me
at the mercy if lucidity
i am adrift in a world all too real

a hollow man!

into the arms of eternal struggle
i must condemn
my restless mind
i must condemn
my restless mind

and it has come to pass
a path set in stone now breaks like glass
the failings of yesterday
become my catalyst to seek my change

and it has come to pass
a path set in stone now breaks like glass
the failings of yesterday
become my catalyst

i seek the guidance gained from silence
illumination from within the darkness
my council kept with the emptiness
in the heart of the unknown"
Iron Man|Black Sabbath|metal|"
i am iron man!


has he lost his mind?
can he see or is he blind?
can he walk at all
or if he moves will he fall?


is he alive or dead?
has he thoughts within his head?
we'll just pass him there
why should we even care?


he was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
when he traveled time
for the future of mankind


nobody wants him
he just stares at the world
planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfurl


now, the time is here
for iron man to spread fear
vengeance from the grave
kills the people he once saved


nobody wants him
they just turn their heads
nobody helps him
now, he has his revenge




heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
running as fast as they can
iron man lives again!

world is you, you're the eternal everything
never-always, one- nothing
you think that destruction is the way
let your own pain be the answer
for nothingness, for non-existence in emptiness
being for not being, religion of black hole
did we find already:
can something that never was give us an answer:
what you truly hate is a part of you
world without move, we flow in substance
devoured by perfect entirety
homogenous millions of perfect shape"

but you can't fool the world...

the curtain falls to no one, nowhere
nobody notices! nobody cares!

soulless - spineless
cut from the beggar's cloth
you fill your skull with their shit till it runs from your mouth

heartless - carcass
i've seen more life in dead men's eyes
i've heard more truths alone with the night

and i'd rather believe in nothing than believe in a fucking lie!
i'd sooner fail one thousand times than regret i never tried!


cause you can fool some people, sometimes
but you can't fool the world for the rest of your life
you can fool some people, sometimes
but you can't fool the world...

you can't fool us all!

you howl at the world, but speak a dead language
you're selling your soul, but no one is buying
you pray to your gods of fashion and industry
heads in the clouds, but you live on your fucking knees

on your knees!

nobody notices! nobody cares!
the curtain falls to no one, nowhere
nobody notices! nobody cares!

Leprosy|Death|metal|"
bodies deformed way beyond belief
cast out from their concerned society
flesh contorting day after day
freak of the dark world is what the people say


their lives decay before their eyes
there is no hope of cure
among their own kind they live
a life that's so obscure
first an arm and then a leg
deterioration grows
rotting while they breathe
death comes slow


leprosy will take control
and bring you to your death
no chance of a normal life
to live just like the rest
leprosy will spread with time
your body soon to change
appearance becomes hideous
a sight too much to take


tuberculoid the most severe
decay of the nerves comes fast
sense of feeling soon to be gone
life will never last


no hope of recovery after the nerves are eaten away
damage is done you feel no more pain
bones decay deterioration grows
origin of this horrid disease nobody knows


their lives decay before their eyes
there is no hope of cure

imagine that this picture of me is painted for you
a portrait is made to hold a moment and moments wish they could live
lets make this last become the real life art
time won't catch us if we refuse to dry
changing as we settle into our canvas of eternity
hung on a wall that was built for you and i


here we are once again and we are the same
you will see all of this and we will remain the same
we are all artwork can't you see
no one will see you like i do
why can't you believe?

the change to come was undetectable
the open wounds expose the importance of
our innocence
a high that can never be bought or sold


symbolic acts, so vivid
yet at the same time
were invisible


savor what you feel and what you see
things that may not seem important now
but may be tomorrow

do you remember when
things seemed so eternal?
heroes were so real
their magic frozen in time
the only way to learn
is be aware and hold on tight

infernal majesty, guide me in my eternal search
lead me to the ancient empire of dark treasures that once were lost

lord of darkness, i speak thy name
bestow me a vision from the deeps beyond the flames
share me the power, enchant my darkened soul
grant me the key to the mysteries

wandering alone in the hall of damnation
enlightened by the reflections of the moon
as voices of the night call my name
i enter the halls of blasphemy
rites of ancient sorcery unknown
since the darkest centuries of time
the hidden chambers reveals the past
engraved in the archways in stone

reveal the unholy secrets, unveil the source of hellish creation
inferal majesty, i summon the infernal forces
let the ancient flame burn
lord - bring us damnation

in the depths of my heart, the sigil of satan engraved

i'm thy faithful servant, the words of summoning i recite

What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse|The Black Dahlia Murder|metal|"this twisted, wretched place shadowed by the utmost darks of hell
in dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell
where the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane
where shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day

liars line the roads at dawn
watchful eyes are upon you held
sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead

unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
the undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
they dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
his spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man

into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
the gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
the rivers flow with poison
the sands swallow you whole
the ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat

unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks

i needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
what did i see? can i believe that what i saw
that night was real and not just fantasy?
just what i saw, in my old dreams, were they
reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
cause in my dreams, it's always there
the evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

yeah!


the night was black, was no use holding back
cause i just had to see, was someone watching me?
in the mist, dark figures move and twist
was all this for real or just some kind of hell?


666 the number of the beast
hell and fire was spawned to be released


torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
as they start to cry, hands held to the sky
in the night, the fires burning bright
the ritual has begun, satan's work is done


666 the number of the beast
sacrifice is going on tonight





this can't go on, i must inform the law
can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
they seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes


666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

in a nation so divided as the english, it could scarcely be expected that the death of one sovereign, and the accession of another, who was generally believed to have embraced opposite principles to those which prevailed, could be the object of universal satisfaction: yet so much were men displeased with the present conduct of affairs, and such apprehensions were entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking their theological disputes, expressed a general and unfeigned joy that the sceptre had passed into the hand of elizabeth. that princess had discovered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her sister; and as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which she was every moment exposed, compassion towards her situation, and concern for her safety, had rendered her, to an uncommon degree, the favorite of the nation. a parliament had been assembled a few days before mary's death; and when heathe, archbishop of york, then chancellor, notified to them that event, scarcely an interval of regret appeared; and the two houses immediately resounded with the joyful acclamations of ""god save queen elizabeth: long and happily may she reign."" the people, less actuated by faction, and less influenced by private views, expressed a joy still more general and hearty on her proclamation; and the auspicious commencement of this reign prognosticated that felicity and glory which, during its whole course, so uniformly attended it.

elizabeth was at hatfield when she heard of her sister's death; and after a few days she went thence to london, through crowds of people, who strove with each other in giving her the strongest testimony of their affection. on her entrance into the tower, she could not forbear reflecting on the great difference between her present fortune and that which a few years before had attended her, when she was conducted to that place as a prisoner, and lay there exposed to all the bigoted malignity of her enemies. she fell on her knees, and expressed her thanks to heaven for the deliverance which the almighty had granted her from her bloody persecutors; a deliverance, she said, no less miraculous than that which daniel had received from the den of lions. this act of pious gratitude seems to have been the last circumstance in which she remembered any past hardships and injuries. with a prudence and magnanimity truly laudable, she buried all offences in oblivion, and received with affability even those who had acted with the greatest malevolence against her. sir henry benningfield himself, to whose custody she had been committed, and who had treated her with severity, never felt, during the whole course of her reign, any effects of her resentment. yet was not the gracious reception which she gave, prostitute and undistinguishing. when the bishops came in a body to make their obeisance to her, she expressed to all of them sentiments of regard; except to bonner, from whom she turned aside, as from a man polluted with blood, who was a just object of horror to every heart susceptible of humanity.

after employing a few days in ordering her domestic affairs, elizabeth notified to foreign courts her sister's death, and her own accession. she sent lord cobham to the low countries, where philip then resided; and she took care to express to that monarch her gratitude for the protection which he had afforded her, and her desire of persevering in that friendship which had so happily commenced between them. philip, who had long foreseen this event, and who still hoped, by means of elizabeth, to obtain that dominion over england, of which he had failed in espousing mary, immediately despatched orders to the duke of feria, his ambassador at london, to make proposals of marriage to the queen; and he offered to procure from rome a dispensation for that purpose. but elizabeth soon came to the resolution of declining the proposal. she saw that the nation had entertained an extreme aversion to the spanish alliance during her sister's reign; and that one great cause of the popularity which she herself enjoyed, was the prospect of being freed by her means from the danger of foreign subjection. she was sensible that her affinity with philip was exactly similar to that of her father with catharine of arragon; and that her marrying that monarch was, in effect, declaring herself illegitimate, and incapable of succeeding to the throne. and though the power of the spanish monarchy might still be sufficient, in opposition to all pretenders, to support her title, her masculine spirit disdained such precarious dominion, which, as it would depend solely on the power of another, must be exercised according to his inclinations. but while these views prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a marriage with philip, she gave him an obliging, though evasive answer; and he still retained such hopes of success, that he sent a messenger to rome, with orders to solicit the dispensation.

* camden in kennet, p. 370. burnet, vol. ii. p. 375.

the queen too, on her sister's death, had written to sir edward carne, the english ambassador at rome, to notify her accession to the pope; but the precipitate nature of paul broke through all the cautious measures concerted by this young princess. he told carne, that england was a fief of the holy see; and it was great temerity in elizabeth to have assumed, without his participation, the title and authority of queen: that being illegitimate, she could not possibly inherit that kingdom; nor could he annul the sentence, pronounced by clement vii. and paul iii., with regard to henry's marriage: that were he to proceed with rigor, he should punish this criminal invasion of his rights, by rejecting all her applications but being willing to treat her with paternal indulgence, he would still keep the door of grace open to her, and that if she would renounce all pretensions to the crown, and submit entirely to his will, she should experience the utmost lenity compatible with the dignity of the apostolic see. when this answer was reported to elizabeth, she was astonished at the character of that aged pontiff; and having recalled her ambassador, she continued with more determined resolution to pursue those measures which already she had secretly embraced.

the queen, not to alarm the partisans of the catholic religion, had retained eleven of her sister's counsellors; but in order to balance their authority, she added eight more, who were known to be inclined to the protestant communion: the marquis of northampton, the earl of bedford, sir thomas parry, sir edward rogers, sir ambrose cave, sir francis knolles, sir nicholas bacon, whom she created lord keeper, and sir william cecil, secretary of state.

* father paul, lib. v.

** strype's ann. vol. i. p. 5.
with these counsellors, particularly cecil, she frequently deliberated concerning the expediency of restoring the protestant religion, and the means of executing that great enterprise. cecil told her, that the greater part of the nation had, ever since her father's reign, inclined to the reformation, and though her sister had constrained them to profess the ancient faith, the cruelties exercised by her ministers had still more alienated their affections from it: that happily the interests of the sovereign here concurred with the inclinations of the people; nor was her title to the crown compatible with the authority of the roman pontiff: that a sentence, so solemnly pronounced by two popes against her mother's marriage, could not possibly be recalled without inflicting a mortal wound on the credit of the see of rome; and even if she were allowed to retain the crown, it would only be on an uncertain and dependent footing: that this circumstance alone counterbalanced all dangers whatsoever; and these dangers themselves, if narrowly examined, would be found very little formidable: that the curses and execrations of the romish church, when not seconded by military force, were, in the present age, more an object of ridicule than of terror, and had now as little influence in this world as in the next: that though the bigotry or ambition of henry or philip might incline them to execute a sentence of excommunication against her, their interests were so incompatible, that they never could concur in any plan of operations; and the enmity of the one would always insure to her the friendship of the other: that if they encouraged the discontents of her catholic subjects, their dominions also abounded with protestants, and it would be easy to retaliate upon them: that even such of the english as seemed at present zealously attached to the catholic faith, would, most of them, embrace the religion of their new sovereign; and the nation had of late been so much accustomed to these revolutions, that men had lost all idea of truth and falsehood in such subjects: that the authority of henry viii., so highly raised by many concurring circumstances, first inured the people to this submissive deference; and it was the less difficult for succeeding princes to continue the nation in a track to which it had so long been accustomed; and that it would be easy for her, by bestowing on protestants all preferment in civil offices and the militia, the church and the universities, both to insure her own authority, and to render her religion entirely predominant.

the education of elizabeth, as well as her interest, led her to favor the reformation; and she remained not long in suspense with regard to the party which she should embrace. but though determined in her own mind, she resolved to proceed by gradual and secure steps, and not to imitate the example of mary in encouraging the bigots of her party to make immediately a violent invasion on the established religion. she thought it requisite, however, to discover such symptoms of her intentions as might give encouragement to the protestants so much depressed by the late violent persecutions. she immediately recalled all the exiles, and gave liberty to the prisoners who were confined on account of religion. we are told of a pleasantry of one rainsford on this occasion, who said to the queen, that he had a petition to present her in behalf of other prisoners called matthew, mark, luke, and john: she readily replied, that it behoved her first to consult the prisoners themselves, and to learn of them whether they desired that liberty which he demanded for them.

        ** burnet, vol. ii. p. 378. camden, p. 371.

        *** heylin, p. 103.

elizabeth also proceeded to exert in favor of the reformers some acts of power which were authorized by the extent of royal prerogative during that age. finding that the protestant teachers, irritated by persecution, broke out in a furious attack on the ancient superstition, and that the romanists replied with no less zeal and acrimony, she published a proclamation, by which she inhibited all preaching without a special license; and though she dispensed with these orders in favor of some preachers of her own sect, she took care that they should be the most calm and moderate of the party. she also suspended the laws so far as to order a great part of the service; the litany, the lord's prayer, the creed, and the gospels; to be read in english. and having first published injunctions, that all the churches should conform themselves to the practice of her own chapel, she forbade the host to be any more elevated in her presence; an innovation which, however frivolous it may appear, implied the most material consequences.

these declarations of her intention, concurring with preceding suspicions, made the bishops foresee with certainty a revolution in religion. they therefore refused to officiate at her coronation; and it was with some difficulty that the bishop of carlisle was at last prevailed on to perform the ceremony. when she was conducted through london, amidst the joyful acclamations of her subjects, a boy, who personated truth, was let down from one of the triumphal arches, and presented to her a copy of the bible. she received the book with the most gracious deportment; placed it next her bosom; and declared that, amidst all the costly testimonies which the city had that day given her of their attachment, this present was by far the most precious and most acceptable. such were the innocent artifices by which elizabeth insinuated herself into the affections of her subjects. open in her address, gracious and affable in all public appearances, she rejoiced in the concourse of her subjects, entered into all their pleasures and amusements; and without departing from her dignity, which she knew well how to preserve, she acquired a popularity beyond what any of her predecessors or successors ever could attain. her own sex exulted to see a woman hold the reins of empire with such prudence and fortitude: and while a young princess of twenty-five years, (for that was her age at her accession,) who possessed all the graces and insinuation, though not all the beauty of her sex, courted the affections of individuals by her civilities, of the public by her services; her authority though corroborated by the strictest bands of law and religion, appeared to be derived entirely from the choice and inclination of the people.

a sovereign of this disposition was not likely to offend her subjects by any useless or violent exertions of power; and elizabeth, though she threw out such hints as encouraged the protestants delayed the entire change of religion till the meeting of the parliament, which was summoned to assemble. the elections had gone entirely against the catholics, who seem not indeed to have made any great struggle for the superiority; and the houses met in a disposition of gratifying the queen in every particular which she could desire of them. they began the session with a unanimous declaration, ""that queen elizabeth was, and ought to be, as well by the word of god, as the common and statute laws of the realm, the lawful, undoubted, and true heir to the crown, lawfully descended from the blood royal, according to the order of succession settled in the thirty-fifth of henry viii.""

        * notwithstanding the bias of the nation towards the
        protestant sect, it appears that some violence, at least
        according to our present ideas, was used in these elections:
        five candidates were nominated by the court to each borough,
        and three to each county; and by the sheriff's authority the
        members were chosen from among these candidates. see state
        papers collected by edward, earl of clarendon, p. 92.

this act of recognition was probably dictated by the queen herself and her ministers; and she showed her magnanimity, as well as moderation, in the terms which she employed on that occasion. she followed not mary's practice in declaring the validity of her mother's marriage, or in expressly repealing the act formerly made against her own legitimacy: she knew that this attempt must be attended with reflections on her father's memory, and on the birth of her deceased sister; and as all the world was sensible, that henry's divorce from anne boleyn was merely the effect of his usual violence and caprice, she scorned to found her title on any act of an assembly which had too much prostituted its authority by its former variable, servile, and iniquitous decisions. satisfied, therefore, in the general opinion entertained with regard to this fact, which appeared the more undoubted, the less anxiety she discovered in fortifying it by votes and inquiries; she took possession of the throne both as her birthright, and as insured to her by former acts of parliament; and she never appeared anxious to distinguish these titles.

the first bill brought into parliament with a view of trying their disposition on the head of religion, was that for suppressing the monasteries lately erected, and for restoring the tenths and first-fruits to the queen. this point being gained without much difficulty, a bill was next introduced, annexing the supremacy to the crown; and though the queen was there denominated ""governess,"" not ""head,"" of the church, it conveyed the same extensive power which under the latter title had been exercised by her father and brother. all the bishops who were present in the upper house strenuously opposed this law; and as they possessed more learning than the temporal peers, they triumphed in the debate; but the majority of voices in that house, as well as among the commons, was against them. by this act, the crown, without the concurrence either of the parliament, or even of the convocation, was vested with the whole spiritual power; might repress all heresies, might establish or repeal all canons, might alter every point of discipline, and might ordain or abolish any religious rite or ceremony,

in determining heresy, the sovereign was only limited (if that could be called a limitation) to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy by the authority of the scripture, by the first four general councils, or by any general council which followed the scripture as their rule, or to such other doctrines as should hereafter be denominated heresy by the parliament and convocation. in order to exercise this authority, the queen, by a clause of the act, was empowered to name commissioners, either laymen or clergymen, as she should think proper; and on this clause was afterwards founded the court of ecclesiastical commission; which assumed large discretionary, not to say arbitrary powers, totally incompatible with any exact boundaries in the constitution. their proceedings, indeed, were only consistent with absolute monarchy; but were entirely suitable to the genius of the act on which they were established; an act that at once gave the crown alone all the power which had formerly been claimed by the popes, but which even these usurping prelates had never been able fully to exercise without some concurrence of the national clergy.

whoever refused to take an oath acknowledging the queen's supremacy, was incapacitated from holding any office; whoever denied the supremacy, or attempted to deprive the queen of that prerogative, forfeited, for the first offence, all his goods and chattels; for the second, was subjected to the penalty of a præmunire; but the third offence was declared treason. these punishments, however severe, were less rigorous than those which were formerly, during the reigns of her father and brother, inflicted in like cases.

a law was passed confirming all the statutes enacted in king edward's time with regard to religion: the nomination of bishops was given to the crown, without any election of the chapters: the queen was empowered, on the vacancy of any see, to seize all the temporalities, and to bestow on the bishop elect an equivalent in the impropriations belonging to the crown. this pretended equivalent was commonly much inferior in value; and thus the queen, amidst all her concern for religion, followed the example of the preceding reformers in committing depredations on the ecclesiastical revenues.
the bishops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating their revenues, and from letting leases longer than twenty-one years or three lives. this law seemed to be meant for securing the property of the church; but as an exception was left in favor of the crown, great abuses still prevailed. it was usual for the courtiers, during this reign, to make an agreement with a bishop or incumbent; and to procure a fictitious alienation to the queen, who afterwards transferred the lands to the person agreed on. this method of pillaging the church was not remedied till the beginning of james i. the present depression of the clergy exposed them to all injuries; and the laity never stopped till they had reduced the church to such poverty, that her plunder was no longer a compensation for the odium incurred by it.

a solemn and public disputation was held during this session in presence of lord keeper bacon, between the divines of the protestant and those of the catholic communion. the champions appointed to defend the religion of the sovereign were, as in all former instances, entirely triumphant; and the popish disputants, being pronounced refractory and obstinate, were even punished by imprisonment.

emboldened by this victory, the protestants ventured on the last and most important step, and brought into parliament a bill for abolishing the mass and reestablishing the liturgy of king edward. penalties were enacted, as well against those who departed from this mode of worship, as against those who absented themselves from the church and the sacraments. and thus in one session, without any violence, tumult, or clamor, was the whole system of religion altered, on the very commencement of a reign, and by the will of a young woman, whose title to the crown was by many thought liable to objections; an event which, though it may appear surprising to men in the present age, was every where expected on the first intelligence of elizabeth's accession.

the commons also made a sacrifice to the queen, more difficult to obtain than that of any articles of faith: they voted a subsidy of four shillings in the pound on land, and two shillings and eightpence on movables, together with two fifteenths. 1 the house in no instance departed from the most respectful deference and complaisance towards the queen. even the importune address which they made her on the conclusion of the session, to fix her choice of a husband, could not, they supposed, be very disagreeable to one of her sex and age. the address was couched in the most respectful expressions, yet met with a refusal from the queen.

she told the speaker, that, as the application from the house was conceived in general terms, only recommending marriage, without pretending to direct her choice of a husband, she could not take offence at the address, or regard it otherwise than as a new instance of their affectionate attachment to her: that any further interposition on their part, would have ill become either them to make as subjects, or her to bear as an independent princess: that even while she was a private person, and exposed to much danger, she had always declined that engagement, which she regarded as an encumbrance; much more, at present, would she persevere in this sentiment, when the charge of a great kingdom was committed to her, and her life ought to be entirely devoted to promoting the interests of religion and the happiness of her subjects: that as england was her husband, wedded to her by this pledge, (and here she showed her finger with the same gold ring upon it with which she had solemnly betrothed herself to the kingdom at her inauguration,) so all englishmen were her children, and while she was employed in rearing or governing such a family, she could not deem herself barren, or her life useless and unprofitable: that if she ever entertained thoughts of changing her condition, the care of her subjects' welfare would still be uppermost in her thoughts; but should she live and die a virgin, she doubted not but divine providence, seconded by their counsels and her own measures, would be able to prevent all dispute with regard to the succession, and secure them a sovereign who, perhaps better than her own issue, would imitate her example in loving and cherishing her people; and that for her part, she desired that no higher character, or fairer remembrance of her should be transmitted to posterity, than to have this inscription engraved on her tombstone, when she should pay the last debt to nature: ""here lies elizabeth, who lived and died a maiden queen.""

after the prorogation of the parliament, the laws enacted with regard to religion were put in execution, and met with little opposition from any quarter. the liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue, and the oath of supremacy was tendered to the clergy. the number of bishops had been reduced to fourteen by a sickly season which preceded: and all these, except the bishop of landaff, having refused compliance, were degraded from their sees: but of the inferior clergy throughout all england, where there are near ten thousand parishes, only eighty rectors and vicars, fifty prebendaries fifteen heads of colleges, twelve archdeacons, and as many deans, sacrificed their livings to their religious principles.

those in high ecclesiastic stations, being exposed to the eyes of the public, seem chiefly to have placed a point of honor in their perseverance; but on the whole, the protestants, in the former change introduced by mary, appear to have been much more rigid and conscientious. though the catholic religion, adapting itself to the senses, and enjoining observances which enter into the common train of life, does at present lay faster hold on the mind than the reformed, which, being chiefly spiritual, resembles more a system of metaphysics, yet was the proportion of zeal, as well as of knowledge, during the first ages after the reformation, much greater on the side of the protestants. the catholics continued, ignorantly and supinely, in their ancient belief, or rather their ancient practices: but the reformers, obliged to dispute on every occasion, and inflamed to a degree of enthusiasm by novelty and persecution had strongly attached themselves to their tenets; and were ready to sacrifice their fortunes, and even their lives, in support of their speculative and abstract principles.

the forms and ceremonies still preserved in the english liturgy, as they bore some resemblance to the ancient service, tended further to reconcile the catholics to the established religion; and as the queen permitted no other mode of worship, and at the same time struck out every thing that could be offensive to them in the new liturgy, even those who were addicted to the romish communion made no scruple of attending the established church. had elizabeth gratified her own inclinations, the exterior appearance, which is the chief circumstance with the people, would have been still more similar between the new and the ancient form of worship. her love of state and magnificence, which she affected in every thing, inspired her with an inclination towards the pomp of the catholic religion; and it was merely in compliance with the prejudices of her party, that she gave up either images, or the addresses to saints, or prayers for the dead. some foreign princes interposed to procure the romanists the privilege of separate assemblies in particular cities, but the queen would not comply with their request; and she represented the manifest danger of disturbing the national peace by a toleration of different religions.

while the queen and parliament were employed in settling the public religion, the negotiations for a peace were still conducted, first at cercamp, then at chateau-cambresis, between the ministers of france, spain, and england; and elizabeth, though equally prudent, was not equally successful in this transaction. philip employed his utmost efforts to procure the restitution of calais, both as bound in honor to indemnify england which merely on his account had been drawn into the war; and as engaged in interest to remove france to a distance from his frontiers in the low countries. so long as he entertained hopes of espousing the queen, he delayed concluding a peace with henry; and even after the change of religion in england deprived him of all such views, his ministers hinted to her a proposal which may be regarded as reasonable and honorable. though all his own terms with france were settled, he seemed willing to continue the war till she should obtain satisfaction; provided she would stipulate to adhere to the spanish alliance, and continue hostilities against henry during the course of six years:* but elizabeth, after consulting with her ministers, wisely rejected this proposal. she was sensible of the low state of her finances; the great debts contracted by her father, brother, and sister; the disorders introduced into every part of the administration; the divisions by which her people were agitated; and she was convinced that nothing but tranquillity during some years could bring the kingdom again into a flourishing condition, or enable her to act with dignity and vigor in her transactions with foreign nations. well acquainted with the value which henry put upon calais, and the impossibility, during the present emergence, of recovering it by treaty, she was willing rather to suffer that loss, than submit to such a dependence on spain, as she must expect to fall into, if she continued pertinaciously in her present demand. she ordered, therefore, her ambassadors, lord effingham, the bishop of ely, and dr. wotton, to conclude the negotiation, and to settle a peace with henry on any reasonable terms. henry offered to stipulate a marriage between the eldest daughter of the dauphin, and the eldest son of elizabeth; and to engage for the restitution of calais as the dowry of that princess; but as the queen was sensible that this treaty would appear to the world a palpable evasion, she insisted upon more equitable, at least more plausible conditions.

        it was at last agreed, that henry should restore calais at
        the expiration of eight years; that in case of failure, he
        should pay five hundred thousand crowns, and the queen's
        title to calais still remain; that he should find the
        security of seven or eight foreign merchants, not natives of
        france, for the payment of this sum; that he should deliver
        five hostages till that security were provided; that if
        elizabeth broke the peace with france or scotland during the
        interval, she should forfeit all title to calais; but if
        henry made war on elizabeth, he should be obliged
        immediately to restore that fortress. all men of
        penetration easily saw that these stipulations were but a
        colorable pretence for abandoning calais; but they excused
        the queen on account of the necessity of her affairs; and
        they even extolled her prudence in submitting without
        further struggle to that necessity. a peace with scotland
        was a necessary consequence of that with france.

philip and henry terminated hostilities by a mutual restitution of all places taken during the course of the war; and philip espoused the princess elizabeth, eldest daughter of france, formerly betrothed to his son don carlos. the duke of savoy married margaret, henry's sister, and obtained a restitution of all his dominions of savoy and piedmont, except a few towns retained by france. and thus general tranquillity seemed to be restored to europe.

but though peace was concluded between france and england, there soon appeared a ground of quarrel of the most serious nature, and which was afterwards attended with the most important consequences. the two marriages of henry viii., that with catharine of arragon, and that with anne boleyn, were incompatible with each other; and it seemed impossible that both of them could be regarded as valid and legal: but still the birth of elizabeth lay under some disadvantages to which that of her sister mary was not exposed. henry's first marriage had obtained the sanction of all the powers, both civil and ecclesiastical, which were then acknowledged in england; and it was natural for protestants as well as romanists to allow, on account of the sincere intention of the parties, that their issue ought to be regarded as legitimate, but his divorce and second marriage had been concluded in direct opposition to the see of rome; and though they had been ratified by the authority both of the english parliament and convocation, those who were strongly attached to the catholic communion, and who reasoned with great strictness were led to regard them as entirely invalid, and to deny altogether the queen's right of succession. the next heir of blood was the queen of scots, now married to the dauphin; and the great power of that princess, joined to her plausible title rendered her a formidable rival to elizabeth. the king of france had secretly been soliciting at rome a bull of excommunication against the queen; and she had here been beholden to the good offices of philip, who, from interest more than either friendship or generosity, had negotiated in her favor, and had successfully opposed the pretensions of henry. but the court of france was not discouraged with this repulse; the duke of guise and his brothers, thinking that it would much augment their credit if their niece should bring an accession of england, as she had already done of scotland, to the crown of france, engaged the king not to neglect the claim; and, by their persuasion, he ordered his son and daughter-in-law to assume openly the arms as well as title of england, and to quarter these arms on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries. when the english ambassador complained of this injury he could obtain nothing but an evasive answer; that as the queen of scots was descended from the blood royal of england, she was entitled, by the example of many princes, to assume the arms of that kingdom. but besides that this practice had never prevailed without permission being first obtained, and without making a visible difference between the arms, elizabeth plainly saw that this pretension had not been advanced during the reign of her sister mary; and that, therefore, the king of france intended, on the first opportunity, to dispute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown. alarmed at the danger, she thenceforth conceived a violent jealousy against the queen of scots; and was determined, as far as possible, to incapacitate henry from the execution of his project. the sudden death of that monarch, who was killed in a tournament at paris, while celebrating the espousals of his sister with the duke of savoy, altered not her views. being informed that his successor, francis ii., still continued to assume, without reserve, the title of king of england, she began to consider him and his queen as her mortal enemies; and the present situation of affairs in scotland afforded her a favorable opportunity, both of revenging the injury, and providing for her own safety.

the murder of the cardinal-primate at st. andrew's had deprived the scottish catholics of a head whose severity, courage, and capacity had rendered him extremely formidable to the innovators in religion; and the execution of the laws against heresy began thenceforth to be more remiss. the queen regent governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate counsels; and as she was not disposed to sacrifice the civil interests of the state to the bigotry or interests of the clergy, she deemed it more expedient to temporize, and to connive at the progress of a doctrine which she had not power entirely to repress. when informed of the death of edward, and the accession of mary to the crown of england, she entertained hopes that the scottish reformers, deprived of the countenance which they received from that powerful kingdom, would lose their ardor with their prospect of success, and would gradually return to the faith of their ancestors. but the progress and revolutions of religion are little governed by the usual maxims of civil policy; and the event much disappointed the expectations of the regent. many of the english preachers, terrified with the severity of mary's government, took shelter in scotland, where they found more protection, and a milder administration; and while they propagated their theological tenets, they filled the whole kingdom with a just horror against the cruelties of the bigoted catholics, and showed their disciples the fate which they must expect, if ever their adversaries should attain an uncontrolled authority over them.

a hierarchy, moderate in its acquisitions of power and riches, may safely grant a toleration to sectaries; and the more it softens the zeal of innovators by lenity and liberty, the more securely will it possess those advantages which the legal establishments bestow upon it. but where superstition has raised a church to such an exorbitant height as that of rome, persecution is less the result of bigotry in the priests, than of a necessary policy; and the rigor of law is the only method of repelling the attacks of men who, besides religious zeal, have so many other motives, derived both from public and private interest, to engage them on the side of innovation. but though such overgrown hierarchies may long support themselves by these violent expedients, the time comes when severities tend only to enrage the new sectaries, and make them break through all bounds of reason and moderation. this crisis was now visibly approaching in scotland; and whoever considers merely the transactions resulting from it, will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties; whoever enlarges his view, and reflects on the situations, will remark the necessary progress of human affairs, and the operation of those principles which are inherent in human nature.

some heads of the reformers in scotland, such as the earl of argyle, his son lord lorne, the earls of morton and glencarne, erskine of dun, and others, observing the danger to which they were exposed, and desirous to propagate their principles, entered privately into a bond or association; and called themselves the ""congregation"" of the lord, in contradistinction to the established church, which they denominated the congregation of satan. the tenor of the bond was as follows: ""we, perceiving how satan, in his members, the antichrist of our time, do cruelly rage, seeking to overthrow and to destroy the gospel of christ and his congregation, ought, according to our bounden duty, to strive in our master's cause, even unto the death, being certain of the victory in him. we do therefore promise, before the majesty of god and his congregation, that we, by his grace, shall with all diligence continually apply our whole power, substance, and our very lives, to maintain, set forward, and establish the most blessed word of god and his congregation; and shall labor, by all possible means, to have faithful ministers, truly and purely to minister christ's gospel and sacraments to his people: we shall maintain them, nourish them, and defend them, the whole congregation of christ, and every member thereof, by our whole power, and at the hazard of our lives, against satan, and all wicked power who may intend tyranny and trouble against the said congregation; unto which holy word and congregation we do join ourselves; and we forsake and renounce the congregation of satan, with all the superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof; and moreover shall declare ourselves manifestly enemies thereto, by this faithful promise before god, testified to this congregation by our subscriptions. at edinburgh, the third of december, 1557.""

had the subscribers of this zealous league been content only to demand a toleration of the new opinions, however incompatible their pretensions might have been with the policy of the church of rome, they would have had the praise of opposing tyrannical laws, enacted to support an establishment prejudicial to civil society: but it is plain that they carried their views much further; and their practice immediately discovered the spirit by which they were actuated. supported by the authority which they thought belonged to them as the congregation of the lord, they ordained that prayers in the vulgar tongue should be used in all the parish churches of the kingdom; and that preaching and the interpretation of the scriptures should be practised in private houses, til god should move the prince to grant public preaching by faithful and true ministers. such bonds of association are always the fore-runners of rebellion; and this violent invasion of the established religion was the actual commencement of it.

before this league was publicly known or avowed, the clergy, alarmed with the progress of the reformation, attempted to recover their lost authority by a violent exercise of power, which tended still further to augment the zeal and number of their enemies. hamilton, the primate, seized walter mill, a priest of an irreproachable life, who had embraced the new doctrines; and having tried him at st. andrew's, condemned him to the flames for heresy. such general aversion was entertained against this barbarity, that it was some time before the bishops could prevail on any one to act the part of a civil judge, and pronounce sentence upon mill; and even after the time of his execution was fixed, all the shops of st. andrew's being shut, no one would sell a rope to tie him to the stake and the primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement. the man bore the torture with that courage which, though usual on these occasions, always appears supernatural and astonishing to the multitude. the people, to express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the priests, raised a monument of stones on the place of his execution; and as fast as the stones were removed by order of the clergy, they were again supplied from the voluntary zeal of the populace. it is in vain for men to oppose the severest punishment to the united motives of religion and public applause; and this was the last barbarity of the kind which the catholics had the power to exercise in scotland.

some time after, the people discovered their sentiments in such a manner as was sufficient to prognosticate to the priests the fate which was awaiting them. it was usual on the festival of st. giles, the tutelar saint of edinburgh, to carry in procession the image of that saint; but the protestants, in order to prevent the ceremony, found means, on the eve of the festival, to purloin the statue from the church; and they pleased themselves with imagining the surprise and disappointment of his votaries. the clergy, however, framed hastily a new image, which in derision was called by the people young st. giles; and they carried it through the streets, attended by all the ecclesiastics in the town and neighborhood. the multitude abstained from violence so long as the queen regent continued a spectator; but the moment she retired, they invaded the idol, threw it in the mire, and broke it in pieces. the flight and terror of the priests and friars, who, it was remarked, deserted, in his greatest distress, the object of their worship, was the source of universal mockery and laughter.

encouraged by all these appearances, the congregation proceeded with alacrity in openly soliciting subscriptions to their league; and the death of mary of england, with the accession of elizabeth, which happened about this time, contributed to increase their hopes of final success in their undertaking. they ventured to present a petition to the regent, craving a reformation of the church, and of the ""wicked, scandalous, and detestable"" lives of the prelates and ecclesiastics. they framed a petition which they intended to present to parliament, and in which, after premising that they could not communicate with the damnable idolatry and intolerable abuses of the papistical church, they desired that the laws against heretics should be executed by the civil magistrate alone, and that the scripture should be the sole rule in judging of heresy. they even petitioned the convocation, and insisted that prayers should be said in the vulgar tongue, and that bishops should be chosen with the consent of the gentry of the diocese, and priests with the consent of the parishioners. the regent prudently temporized between these parties; and as she aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her son-in-law the dauphin, she was, on that as well as other accounts, unwilling to come to extremities with either of them.

but after this concession was obtained, she received orders from france, probably dictated by the violent spirit of her brothers, to proceed with rigor against the reformers, and to restore the royal authority by some signal act of power. she made the more eminent of the protestant teachers be cited to appear before the council at stirling; but when their followers were marching thither in great multitudes, in order to protect and countenance them, she entertained apprehensions of an insurrection, and, it is said, dissipated the people by a promise 2 that nothing should be done to the prejudice of the ministers. sentence, however, was passed, by which all the ministers were pronounced rebels, on account of their not appearing; a measure which enraged the people, and made them resolve to oppose the regent's authority by force of arms, and to proceed to extremities against the clergy of the established religion.

in this critical time, john knox arrived from geneva, where he had passed some years in banishment, and where he had imbibed, from his commerce with calvin, the highest fanaticism of his sect, augmented by the native ferocity of his own character. he had been invited back to scotland by the leaders of the reformation; and mounting the pulpit at perth, during the present ferment of men's minds, he declaimed with his usual vehemence against the idolatry and other abominations of the church of rome, and incited his audience to exert their utmost zeal for its subversion. a priest was so imprudent, after this sermon, as to open his repository of images and relics, and prepare himself to say mass. the audience, exalted to a disposition for any furious enterprise, were as much enraged as if the spectacle had not been quite familiar to them: they attacked the priest with fury, broke the images in pieces, tore the pictures, overthrew the altars, scattered about the sacred vases; and left no implement of idolatrous worship, as they termed it, entire or undefaced. they thence proceeded, with additional numbers and augmented rage, to the monasteries of the gray and black friars, which they pillaged in an instant: the carthusians underwent the same fate: and the populace, not content with robbing and expelling the monks, vented their fury on the buildings which had been the receptacles of such abomination; and in a little time nothing but the walls of these edifices were left standing. the inhabitants of coupar, in fife, soon after imitated the example.

the queen regent, provoked at these violences, assembled an army, and prepared to chastise the rebels. she had about two thousand french under her command, with a few scottish troops; and being assisted by such of the nobility as were well affected to her, she pitched her camp within ten miles of perth. even the earl of argyle, and lord james stuart, prior of st. andrew's, the queen's natural brother, though deeply engaged with the reformers, attended the regent in this enterprise, either because they blamed the fury of the populace, or hoped by their own influence and authority to mediate some agreement between the parties. the congregation, on the other hand, made preparations for defence; and being joined by the earl of glencarne from the west, and being countenanced by many of the nobility and gentry, they appeared formidable from their numbers, as well as from the zeal by which they were animated. they sent an address to the regent, where they plainly insinuated, that if they were pursued to extremities by the ""cruel beasts"" the churchmen, they would have recourse to foreign powers for assistance; and they subscribed themselves her faithful subjects in all things not repugnant to god, assuming, at the same time, the name of the faithful congregation of christ jesus. they applied to the nobility attending her, and maintained, that their own past violences were justified by the word of god, which commands the godly to destroy idolatry, and all the monuments of it; and though all civil authority was sacred, yet was there a great difference between the authority and the persons who exercised it; and that it ought to be considered, whether or not those abominations, called by the pestilent papists religion, and which they defend by fire and sword, be the true religion of christ jesus. they remonstrated with such of the queen's army as had formerly embraced their party, and told them, ""that as they were already reputed traitors by god, they should likewise be excommunicated from their society, and from the participation of the sacraments of the church which god by his mighty power had erected among them; whose ministers have the same authority which christ granted to his apostles in these words, 'whose sins ye shall forgive shall be forgiven, and whose sins ye shall retain shall be retained.'""

we may here see, that these new saints were no less lofty in their pretensions than the ancient hierarchy: no wonder they were enraged against the latter as their rivals in dominion. they joined to all these declarations an address to the established church; and they affixed this title to it: ""to the generation of antichrist, the pestilent prelates and their 'shavelings' in scotland, the congregation of christ jesus within the same sayeth."" the tenor of the manifesto was suitable to the title. they told the ecclesiastics, ""as ye by tyranny intend not only to destroy our bodies, but also by the same to hold our souls in bondage of the devil, subject to idolatry, so shall we, with all the force and power which god shall grant unto us, execute just vengeance and punishment upon you: yea, we shall begin that same war which god commanded israel to execute against the canaanites; that is, contract of peace shall never be made till you desist from your open idolatry, and cruel persecution of god's children. and this, in the name of the eternal god, and of his son christ jesus, whose verity we profess, and gospel we have preached, and holy sacraments rightly administered, we signify unto you to be our intent, so far as god will assist us to withstand your idolatry. take this for warning, and be not deceived."" with these outrageous symptoms commenced in scotland that can't, hypocrisy, and fanaticism which long infested that kingdom, and which, though now mollified by the lenity of the civil power, is still ready to break out on all occasions.

the queen regent, finding such obstinate zeal in the rebels, was content to embrace the counsels of argyle and the prior of st. andrew's, and to form an accommodation with them. she was received into perth, which submitted, on her promising an indemnity for past offences, and engaging not to leave any french garrison in the place. complaints, very ill founded, immediately arose concerning the infraction of this capitulation. some of the inhabitants, it was pretended, were molested on account of the late violences; and some companies of scotch soldiers, supposed to be in french pay, were quartered in the town; which step, though taken on very plausible grounds, was loudly exclaimed against by the congregation.

it is asserted that the regent, to justify these measures, declared, that princes ought not to have their promises too strictly urged upon them; nor was any faith to be kept with heretics: and that for her part, could she find as good a color, she would willingly bereave all these men of their lives and fortunes. but it is nowise likely that such expressions ever dropped from this prudent and virtuous princess. on the contrary, it appears that all these violences were disagreeable to her; that she was in this particular overruled by the authority of the french counsellors placed about her; and that she often thought, if the management of those affairs had been intrusted wholly to herself, she could easily, without force, have accommodated all differences. 3

the congregation, inflamed with their own zeal, and enraged by these disappointments, remained not long in tranquillity. even before they left perth, and while as yet they had no color to complain of any violation of treaty, they had signed a new covenant, in which, besides their engagements to mutual defence, they vowed, in the name of god, to employ their whole power in destroying every thing that dishonored his holy name; and this covenant was subscribed, among others, by argyle and the prior of st. andrew's.

these two leaders now desired no better pretence for deserting the regent and openly joining their associates, than the complaints, however doubtful, or rather false, of her breach of promise. the congregation also, encouraged by this accession of force, gave themselves up entirely to the furious zeal of knox, and renewed at crail, anstruther, and other places in fife, like depredations on the churches and monasteries with those formerly committed at perth and coupar. the regent, who marched against them with her army, finding their power so much increased, was glad to conclude a truce for a few days, and to pass over with her forces to the lothians. the reformers besieged and took perth; proceeded thence to stirling, where they exercised their usual fury; and finding nothing able to resist them, they bent their march to edinburgh, the inhabitants of which, as they had already anticipated the zeal of the congregation against the churches and monasteries, gladly opened their gates to them. the regent, with the few forces which remained with her, took shelter in dunbar, where she fortified herself, in expectation of a reënforcement from france.

meanwhile, she employed her partisans in representing to the people the dangerous consequences of this open rebellion; and she endeavored to convince them, that the lord james, under pretence of religion, had formed the scheme of wresting the sceptre from the hands of the sovereign. by these considerations many were engaged to desert the army of the congregation; but much more by the want of pay, or any means of subsistence; and the regent, observing the malecontents to be much weakened, ventured to march to edinburgh, with a design of suppressing them. on the interposition of the duke of chatelrault, who still adhered to her, she agreed to a capitulation, in which she granted them a toleration of their religion, and they engaged to commit no further depredations on the churches. soon after, they evacuated the city; and before they left it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but they took care to publish only the articles favorable to themselves, and they were guilty of an imposture, in adding one to the number, namely, that idolatry should not again be erected in any place where it was at that time suppressed. 4

an agreement concluded while men were in this disposition, could not be durable; and both sides endeavored to strengthen themselves as much as possible against the ensuing rupture, which appeared inevitable. the regent, having got a reënforcement of one thousand men from france, began to fortify leith; and the congregation seduced to their party the duke of chatelrault, who had long appeared inclined to join them, and who was at last determined by the arrival of his son, the earl of arran, from france, where he had escaped many dangers from the jealousy, as well as bigotry, of henry and the duke of guise. more french troops soon after disembarked under the command of la brosse, who was followed by the bishop of amiens, and three doctors of the sorbonne. these last were supplied with store of syllogisms, authorities, citations, and scholastic arguments, which they intended to oppose to the scottish preachers, and which, they justly presumed, would acquire force, and produce conviction, by the influence of the french arms and artillery.

the constable montmorency had always opposed the marriage of the dauphin with the queen of scots, and had foretold that, by forming such close connections with scotland, the ancient league would be dissolved; and the natives of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign yoke, would soon become, instead of allies, attached by interest and inclination, the most inveterate enemies to the french government. but though the event seemed now to have justified the prudence of that aged minister, it is not improbable, considering the violent counsels by which france was governed, that the insurrection was deemed a favorable event; as affording a pretence for sending over armies, for entirely subduing the country, for attainting the rebels, and for preparing means thence to invade england, and support mary's title to the crown of that kingdom. the leaders of the congregation, well acquainted with these views, were not insensible of their danger, and saw that their only safety consisted in the vigor and success of their measures. they were encouraged by the intelligence received of the sudden death of henry ii.; and having passed an act from their own authority, depriving the queen dowager of the regency, and ordering all the french troops to evacuate the kingdom, they collected forces to put their edict in execution against them. they again became masters of edinburgh; but found themselves unable to keep long possession of that city. their tumultuary armies, assembled in haste, and supported by no pay, soon separated upon the least disaster, or even any delay of success; and were incapable of resisting such veteran troops as the french, who were also seconded by some of the scottish nobility, among whom the earl of bothwell distinguished himself., hearing that the marquis of elbeuf, brother to the regent, was levying an army against them in germany, they thought themselves excusable for applying, in this extremity, to the assistance of england; and as the sympathy of religion, as well as regard to national liberty, had now counterbalanced the ancient animosity against that kingdom, this measure was the result of inclination no less than of interest. 5 maitland of lidington, therefore, and robert melvil, were secretly despatched by the congregation to solicit succors from elizabeth.

the wise council of elizabeth did not long deliberate in agreeing to this request, which concurred so well with the views and interests of their mistress. cecil in particular represented to the queen, that the union of the crowns of scotland and france, both of them the hereditary enemies of england, was ever regarded as a pernicious event; and her father, as well as protector somerset, had employed every expedient both of war and negotiation to prevent it: that the claim which mary advanced to the crown rendered the present situation of england still more dangerous, and demanded on the part of the queen the greatest vigilance and precaution; that the capacity, ambition, and exorbitant views of the family of guise, who now governed the french counsels, were sufficiently known; and they themselves made no secret of their design to place their niece on the throne of england: that deeming themselves secure of success, they had already, somewhat imprudently and prematurely, taken off the mask; and throgmorton, the english ambassador at paris, sent over, by every courier, incontestable proofs of their hostile intentions: that they only waited till scotland should be entirely subdued; and having thus deprived the english of the advantages resulting from their situation and naval power, they prepared means for subverting the queen's authority: that the zealous catholics in england, discontented with the present government, and satisfied in the legality of mary's title, would bring them considerable reënforcement, and would disturb every measure of defence against that formidable power: that the only expedient for preventing these designs, was to seize the present opportunity, and take advantage of a like zeal in the protestants of scotland; nor could any doubt be entertained with regard to the justice of a measure founded on such evident necessity, and directed only to the ends of self-preservation: that though a french war, attended with great expense, seemed the necessary consequence of supporting the malecontents in scotland, that power, if removed to the continent, would be much less formidable; and a small disbursement at present would, in the end, be found the greatest frugality: and that the domestic dissensions of france, which every day augmented, together with the alliance of philip, who, notwithstanding his bigotry and hypocrisy, would never permit the entire conquest of england, were sufficient to secure the queen against the dangerous ambition and resentment of the house of guise.

elizabeth's propensity to caution and economy was, though with some difficulty, overcome by these powerful motives and she prepared herself to support by arms and money the declining affairs of the congregation in scotland. she equipped a fleet, which consisted of thirteen ships of war; and giving the command of it to winter, she sent it to the frith of forth: she appointed the young duke of norfolk her lieutenant in the northern counties; and she assembled, at berwick, an army of eight thousand men under the command of lord gray, warden of the east and middle marches. though the court of france, sensible of the danger, offered her to make immediate restitution of calais, provided she would not interpose in the affairs of scotland, she resolutely replied, that she never would put an inconsiderable fishing-town in competition with the safety of her dominions; and she still continued her preparations. she concluded a treaty of mutual defence with the congregation, which was to last during the marriage of the queen of scots with francis, and a year after; and she promised never to desist till the french had entirely evacuated scotland. and having thus taken all proper measures for success, and received from the scots six hostages for the performance of articles, she ordered her fleet and army to begin their operations.

the appearance of elizabeth's fleet in the frith disconcerted the french army, who were at that time ravaging the county of fife; and obliged them to make a circuit by stirling, in order to reach leith, where they prepared themselves for defence. the english army, reënforced by five thousand scots, sat down before the place; and after two skirmishes, in the former of which the english had the advantage, in the latter the french, they began to batter the town; and, though repulsed with considerable loss in a rash and ill-conducted assault, they reduced the garrison to great difficulties. their distress was augmented by two events; the dispersion by a storm of d'elbeuf's fleet, which carried a considerable army on board, and the death of the queen, regent, who expired about this time in the castle of edinburgh; a woman endowed with all the capacity which shone forth in her family, but possessed of much more virtue and moderation than appeared in the conduct of the other branches of it. the french, who found it impossible to subsist for want of provisions, and who saw that the english were continually reënforced by fresh numbers, were obliged to capitulate; and the bishop of valence and count randan, plenipotentiaries from france, signed a treaty at edinburgh with cecil and dr. wotton, whom elizabeth had sent thither for that purpose. it was there stipulated, that the french should instantly evacuate scotland; that the king and queen of france and scotland should thenceforth abstain from bearing the arms of england, or assuming the title of that kingdom; that further satisfaction for the injury already done in that particular should be granted elizabeth; and that commissioners should meet to settle this point, or, if they could not agree, that the king of spain should be umpire between the crowns. besides these stipulations, which regarded england, some concessions were granted to the scots; namely, that an amnesty should be published for all past offences; that none but natives should enjoy any office in scotland; that the states should name twenty-four persons, of whom the queen of scots should choose seven, and the states five, and in the hands of these twelve should the whole administration be placed during their queen's absence; and that mary should neither make peace nor war without consent of the states. in order to hasten the execution of this important treaty, elizabeth sent ships, by which the french forces were transported into their own country.

thus europe saw, in the first transaction of this reign, the genius and capacity of the queen and her ministers. she discerned at a distance the danger which threatened her; and instantly took vigorous measures to prevent it. making all possible advantages of her situation, she proceeded with celerity to a decision; and was not diverted by any offers, negotiations, or remonstrances of the french court. she stopped not till she had brought the matter to a final issue; and had converted that very power, to which her enemies trusted for her destruction, into her firmest support and security. by exacting no improper conditions from the scottish malecontents, even during their greatest distresses, she established an entire confidence with them; and having cemented the union by all the ties of gratitude, interest, and religion, she now possessed an influence over them beyond what remained even with their native sovereign. the regard which she acquired by this dexterous and spirited conduct, gave her every where, abroad as well as at home, more authority than had attended her sister, though supported by all the power of the spanish monarchy.

the subsequent measures of the scottish reformers tended still more to cement their union with england. being now entirely masters of the kingdom, they made no further ceremony or scruple in fully effecting their purpose. in the treaty of edinburgh, it had been agreed, that a parliament or convention should soon be assembled; and the leaders of the congregation, not waiting till the queen of scots should ratify that treaty, thought themselves fully entitled, without the sovereign's authority, immediately to summon a parliament. the reformers presented a petition to this assembly, in which they were not contented with desiring the establishment of their doctrine, they also applied for the punishment of the catholics, whom they called vassals to the roman harlot; and they asserted, that among all the rabble of the clergy—such is their expression—there was not one lawful minister; but that they were all of them thieves and murderers; yea, rebels and traitors to civil authority, and therefore unworthy to be suffered in any reformed commonwealth. the parliament seem to have been actuated by the same spirit of rage and persecution. after ratifying a confession of faith agreeable to the new doctrines, they passed a statute against the mass, and not only abolished it in all the churches, but enacted, that whoever any where either officiated in it, or was present at it, should be chastised, for the first offence, with confiscation of goods and corporal punishment, at the discretion of the magistrate; for the second, with banishment; and for the third, with loss of life.

a law was also voted for abolishing the papal jurisdiction in scotland: the presbyterian form of discipline was settled, leaving only at first some shadow of authority to certain ecclesiastics, whom they called superintendents. the prelates of the ancient faith appeared, in order to complain of great injustice committed on them by the invasion of their property, but the parliament took no notice of them; till at last these ecclesiastics, tired with fruitless attendance, departed the town. they were then cited to appear; and as nobody presented himself, it was voted by the parliament, that the ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied, and found no reason of complaint.

sir james sandilands, prior of st. john, was sent over to france to obtain the ratification of these acts; but was very ill received by mary, who denied the validity of a parliament summoned without the royal consent; and she refused her sanction to those statutes. but the protestants gave themselves little concern about their queen's refusal. they immediately put the statutes in execution; they abolished the mass; they settled their ministers; they committed every where furious devastations on the monasteries, and even on the churches, which they thought profaned by idolatry; and deeming the property of the clergy lawful prize, they took possession, without ceremony, of the far greater part of the ecclesiastical revenues. their new preachers, who had authority sufficient to incite them to war and insurrection, could not restrain their rapacity; and fanaticism concurring with avarice, an incurable wound was given to the papal authority in that country. the protestant nobility and gentry, united by the consciousness of such unpardonable guilt, alarmed for their new possessions, well acquainted with the imperious character of the house of guise, saw no safety for themselves but in the protection of england; and they despatched morton, glencarne, and lidington, to express their sincere gratitude to the queen for her past favors, and represent to her the necessity of continuing them.
elizabeth, on her part, had equal reason to maintain a union with the scottish protestants; and soon found that the house of guise, notwithstanding their former disappointments, had not laid aside the design of contesting her title, and subverting her authority. francis and mary, whose counsels were wholly directed by them, refused to ratify the treaty of edinburgh and showed no disposition to give her any satisfaction for that mortal affront which they had put upon her, by their openly assuming the title and arms of england. she was sensible of the danger attending such pretensions; and it was with pleasure she heard of the violent factions which prevailed in the french government, and of the opposition which had arisen against the measures of the duke of guise. that ambitious prince, supported by his four brothers, the cardinal of lorraine, the duke of aumale, the marquis of elbeuf, and the grand prior, men no less ambitious than himself, had engrossed all the authority of the crown; and as he was possessed of every quality which could command the esteem or seduce the affections of men, there appeared no end of his acquisitions and pretensions. the constable, montmorency, who had long balanced his credit, was deprived of all power: the princes of the blood, the king of navarre, and his brother, the prince of condé, were entirely excluded from offices and favor: the queen mother herself, catharine de medicis, found her influence every day declining; and as francis, a young prince, infirm both in mind and body, was wholly governed by his consort, who knew no law but the pleasure of her uncles, men despaired of ever obtaining freedom from the dominion of that aspiring family. it was the contests of religion which first inspired the french with courage openly to oppose their unlimited authority.

the theological disputes, first started in the north of germany, next in switzerland, countries at that time wholly illiterate, had long ago penetrated into france; and as they were assisted by the general discontent against the court and church of rome, and by the zealous spirit of the age, the proselytes to the new religion were secretly increasing in every province. henry ii., in imitation of his father, francis, had opposed the progress of the reformers; and though a prince addicted to pleasure and society, he was transported by a vehemence, as well as bigotry, which had little place in the conduct of his predecessor. rigorous punishments had been inflicted on the most eminent of the protestant party; and a point of honor seemed to have arisen, whether the one sect could exercise, or the other suffer, most barbarity. the death of henry put some stop to the persecutions; and the people, who had admired the constancy of the new preachers, now heard with favor their doctrines and arguments. but the cardinal of lorraine, as well as his brothers, who were possessed of the legal authority, thought it their interest to support the established religion; and when they revived the execution of the penal statutes, they necessarily drove the malecontent princes and nobles to embrace the protection of the new religion. the king of navarre, a man of mild dispositions, but of a weak character, and the prince of condé, who possessed many great qualities, having declared themselves in favor of the protestants, that sect acquired new force from their countenance; and the admiral, coligny, with his brother andelot, no longer scrupled to make open profession of their communion. the integrity of the admiral, who was believed sincere in his attachment to the new doctrine, and his great reputation both for valor and conduct, for the arts of peace as well as of war brought credit to the reformers; and after a frustrated attempt of the malecontents to seize the king's person at amboise of which elizabeth had probably some intelligence, every place was full of distraction, and matters hastened to an open rupture between the parties. but the house of guise, though these factions had obliged them to remit their efforts in scotland, and had been one chief cause of elizabeth's success, were determined not to relinquish their authority in france, or yield to the violence of their enemies. they found an opportunity of seizing the king of navarre and the prince of condé; they threw the former into prison; they obtained a sentence of death against the latter; and they were proceeding to put the sentence in execution, when the king's sudden death saved the noble prisoner, and interrupted the prosperity of the duke of guise. the queen mother was appointed regent to her son charles ix., now in his minority: the king of navarre was named lieutenant-general of the kingdom: the sentence against condé was annulled: the constable was recalled to court: and the family of guise, though they still enjoyed great offices and great power, found a counterpoise to their authority.

elizabeth was determined to make advantage of these events against the queen of scots, whom she still regarded as a dangerous rival. she saw herself freed from the perils attending a union of scotland with france, and from the pretensions of so powerful a prince as francis; but she considered, at the same time, that the english catholics, who were numerous, and who were generally prejudiced in favor of mary's title, would now adhere to that princess with more zealous attachment, when they saw that her succession no longer endangered the liberties of the kingdom, and was rather attended with the advantage of effecting an entire union with scotland. she gave orders, therefore, to her ambassador, throgmorton, a vigilant and able minister, to renew his applications to the queen of scots, and to require her ratification of the treaty of edinburgh. but though mary had desisted, after her husband's death, from bearing the arms and title of queen of england, she still declined gratifying elizabeth in this momentous article; and being swayed by the ambitious suggestions of her uncles, she refused to make any formal renunciation of her pretensions.

meanwhile the queen mother of france, who imputed to mary all the mortifications which she had met with during francis's lifetime, took care to retaliate on her by like injuries; and the queen of scots, finding her abode in france disagreeable, began to think of returning to her native country. lord james, who had been sent in deputation from the states to invite her over, seconded these intentions; and she applied to elizabeth, by d'oisel, for a safe-conduct, in case she should be obliged to pass through england; but she received for answer, that, till she had given satisfaction, by ratifying the treaty of edinburgh, she could expect no favor from a person whom she had so much injured.

        * goodall, vol. i. p. 175.

this denial excited her indignation; and she made no scruple of expressing her sentiments to throgmorton, when he reiterated his applications to gratify his mistress in a demand which he represented as so reasonable. having cleared the room of her attendants, she said to him, ""how weak i may prove, or how far a woman's frailty may transport me, i cannot tell: however, i am resolved not to have so many witnesses of my infirmity as your mistress had at her audience of my ambassador d'oisel. there is nothing disturbs me so much, as the having asked, with so much impunity, a favor which it was of no consequence for me to obtain. i can, with god's leave, return to my own country without her leave; as i came to france, in spite of all the opposition of her brother, king edward: neither do i want friends both able and willing to conduct me home, as they have brought me hither; though i was desirous rather to make an experiment of your mistress's friendship, than of the assistance of any other person. i have often heard you say, that a good correspondence between her and myself would conduce much to the security and happiness of both our kingdoms: were she well convinced of this truth, she would hardly have denied me so small a request. but perhaps she bears a better inclination to my rebellious subjects than to me, their sovereign, her equal in royal dignity, her near relation, and the undoubted heir of her kingdoms. besides her friendship, i ask nothing at her hands: i neither trouble her, nor concern myself in the affairs of her state: not that i am ignorant, that there are now in england a great many malecontents, who are no friends to the present establishment. she is pleased to upbraid me as a person little experienced in the world: i freely own it; but age will cure that defect. however, i am already old enough to acquit myself honestly and courteously to my friends and relations, and to encourage no reports of your mistress which would misbecome a queen and her kinswoman. i would also say, by her leave, that i am a queen as well as she, and not altogether friendless: and, perhaps, i have as great a soul too; so that methinks we should be upon a level in our treatment of each other. as soon as i have consulted the states of my kingdom, i shall be ready to give her a seasonable answer; and i am the more intent on my journey, in order to make the quicker despatch in this affair. but she, it seems, intends to stop my journey; so that either she will not let me give her satisfaction, or is resolved not to be satisfied; perhaps on purpose to keep up the disagreement between us. she has often reproached me with my being young; and i must be very young indeed, and as ill advised, to treat of matters of such great concern and importance without the advice of my parliament. i have not been wanting in all friendly offices to her; but she disbelieves or overlooks them. i could heartily wish that i were as nearly allied to her in affection as in blood; for that indeed would be a most valuable alliance.""

such a spirited reply, notwithstanding the obliging terms interspersed in it, was but ill fitted to conciliate friendship between these rival princesses, or cure those mutual jealousies which had already taken place. elizabeth equipped a fleet on pretence of pursuing pirates, but probably with an intention of intercepting the queen of scots in her return homewards. mary embarked at calais; and passing the english fleet in a fog, arrived safely at leith, attended by her three uncles, the duke of aumale, the grand prior, and the marquis of elbeuf, together with the marquis of damville and other french courtiers. this change of abode and situation was very little agreeable to that princess. besides her natural prepossessions in favor of a country in which she had been educated from her earliest infancy, and where she had borne so high a rank, she could not forbear both regretting the society of that people, so celebrated for their humane disposition and their respectful attachment to their sovereign, and reflecting on the disparity of the scene which lay before her. it is said, that after she was embarked at calais, she kept her eyes fixed on the coast of france, and never turned them from that beloved object till darkness fell, and intercepted it from her view. she then ordered a couch to be spread for her in the open air; and charged the pilot, that, if in the morning the land were still in sight, he should awake her, and afford her one parting view of that country in which all her affections were centred. the weather proved calm, so that the ship made little way in the night-time; and mary had once more an opportunity of seeing the french coast. she sat up on her couch, and still looking towards the land, often repeated these words: ""farewell, france, farewell, i shall never see thee more."" the first aspect, however, of things in scotland was more favorable, if not to her pleasure and happiness, at least to her repose and security, than she had reason to apprehend. no sooner did the french galleys appear off leith, than people of all ranks, who had long expected their arrival, flocked towards the shore with an earnest impatience to behold and receive their young sovereign. some were led by duty, some by interest, some by curiosity; and all combined to express their attachment to her, and to insinuate themselves into her confidence on the commencement of her administration. she had now reached her nineteenth year; and the bloom of her youth and amiable beauty of her person were further recommended by the affability of her address, the politeness of her manners, and the elegance of her genius. well accomplished in all the superficial but engaging graces of a court, she afforded, when better known, still more promising indications of her character; and men prognosticated both humanity from her soft and obliging deportment, and penetration from her taste in all the refined arts of music, eloquence, and poetry. and as the scots had long been deprived of the presence of their sovereign, whom they once despaired ever more to behold among them, her arrival seemed to give universal satisfaction; and nothing appeared about the court but symptoms of affection, joy, and festivity.

the first measures which mary embraced confirmed all the prepossessions entertained in her favor. she followed the advice given her in france by d'oisel and the bishop of amiens, as well as her uncles; and she bestowed her confidence entirely on the leaders of the reformed party, who had greatest influence over the people, and who, she found, were alone able to support her government. her brother, lord james, whom she soon after created earl of murray, obtained the chief authority; and after him lidington, secretary of state, a man of great sagacity, had a principal share in her confidence. by the vigor of these men's measures, she endeavored to establish order and justice in a country divided by public factions and private feuds; and that fierce, intractable people, unacquainted with laws and obedience, seemed, for a time, to submit peaceably to her gentle and prudent administration.

but there was one circumstance which blasted all these promising appearances, and bereaved mary of that general favor which her agreeable manners and judicious deportment gave her just reason to expect. she was still a papist, and though she published, soon after her arrival, a proclamation enjoining every one to submit to the established religion, the preachers and their adherents could neither be reconciled to a person polluted with so great an abomination, nor lay aside their jealousies of her future conduct. it was with great difficulty she could obtain permission for saying mass in her own chapel; and had not the people apprehended, that if she had here met with a refusal, she would instantly have returned to france, the zealots never would have granted her even that small indulgence. the cry was, ""shall we suffer that idol to be again erected within the realm?"" it was asserted in the pulpit, that one mass was more terrible than ten thousand armed men landed to invade the kingdom: lord lindesey, and the gentlemen of fife, exclaimed, ""that the idolater should die the death;"" such was their expression. one that carried tapers for the ceremony of that worship was attacked and insulted in the court of the palace. and if lord james and some popular leaders had not interposed, the most dangerous uproar was justly apprehended from the ungoverned fury of the multitude.

the usual prayers in the churches were to this purpose: that god would turn the queen's heart, which was obstinate against him and his truth; or if his holy will be otherwise, that he would strengthen the hearts and hands of the elect, stoutly to oppose the rage of all tyrants. nay, it was openly called in question, whether that princess, being an idolatress, was entitled to any authority, even in civil matters.

the helpless queen was every moment exposed to contumely, which she bore with benignity and patience. soon after her arrival, she dined in the castle of edinburgh; and it was there contrived, that a boy, six years of age, should be let down from the roof, and should present her with a bible, a psalter, and the keys of the castle. lest she should be at a loss to understand this insult on her as a papist, all the decorations expressed the burning of corah, dathan, and abiram, and other punishments inflicted by god upon idolatry. the town council of edinburgh had the assurance, from their own authority, to issue a proclamation banishing from their district ""all the wicked rabble of antichrist the pope, such as priests, monks, friars, together with adulterers and fornicators."" and because the privy council suspended the magistrates for their insolence, the passionate historians of that age have inferred that the queen was engaged, by a sympathy of manners, to take adulterers and fornicators under her protection. it appears probable, that the magistrates were afterwards reinstated in their office, and that their proclamation was confirmed.

but all the insolence of the people was inconsiderable in comparison of that which was exercised by the clergy and the preachers, who took a pride in vilifying, even to her face, this amiable princess. the assembly of the church framed an address, in which, after telling her that her mass was a bastard service of god, the fountain of all impiety, and the source of every evil which abounded in the realm, they expressed their hopes, that she would ere this time have preferred truth to her own preconceived opinion, and have renounced her religion, which, they assured her, was nothing but abomination and vanity. they said, that the present abuses of government were so enormous, that if a speedy remedy were not provided, god would not fail in his anger to strike the head and the tail, the disobedient prince and sinful people. they required, that severe punishment should be inflicted on adulterers and fornicators. and they concluded with demanding for themselves some addition both of power and property.

the ringleader in all these insults on majesty was john knox; who possessed an uncontrolled authority in the church and even in the civil affairs of the nation, and who triumphed in the contumelious usage of his sovereign. his usual appellation for the queen was jezebel; and though she endeavored by the most gracious condescension to win his favor, all her insinuations could gain nothing on his obdurate heart. she promised him access to her whenever he demanded it; and she even desired him, if he found her blamable in any thing, to reprehend her freely in private, rather than vilify her in the pulpit before the whole people: but he plainly told her, that he had a public ministry intrusted to him; that if she would come to church, she should there hear the gospel of truth, and that it was not his business to apply to every individual, nor had he leisure for that occupation. the political principles of the man, which he communicated to his brethren, were as full of sedition, as his theological were of rage and bigotry. though he once condescended so far as to tell the queen that he would submit to her, in the same manner as paul did to nero, he remained not long in this dutiful strain. he said to her, that ""samuel feared not to slay agag the fat and delicate king of amalek, whom king saul had saved; neither spared elias jezebel's false prophets, and baal's priests, though king ahab was present. phineas,"" added he, ""was no magistrate; yet feared he not to strike cosbi and zimri in the very act of filthy fornication. and so, madam, your grace may see that others than chief magistrates may lawfully inflict punishment on such crimes as are condemned by the law of god."" knox had formerly, during the reign of mary of england, written a book against female succession to the crown: the title of it is, ""the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regimen of women."" he was too proud either to recant the tenets of this book, or even to apologize for them; and his conduct showed that he thought no more civility than loyalty due to any of the female sex.

the whole life of mary was, from the demeanor of these men, filled with bitterness and sorrow. this rustic apostle scruples not, in his history, to inform us, that he once treated her with such severity, that she lost all command of temper, and dissolved in tears before him: yet so far from being moved with youth, and beauty, and royal dignity reduced to that condition, he persevered in his insolent reproofs; and when he relates this incident, he discovers a visible pride and satisfaction in his own conduct. the pulpits had become mere scenes of railing against the vices of the court; among which were always noted as the principal, feasting, finery, dancing, balls, and whoredom, their necessary attendant. some ornaments, which the ladies at that time wore upon their petticoats, excited mightily the indignation of the preachers; and they affirmed, that such vanity would provoke god's vengeance not only against these foolish women, but against the whole realm.

mary, whose age, condition, and education, invited her to liberty and cheerfulness, was curbed in all amusements by the absurd severity of these reformers; and she found every moment reason to regret her leaving that country, from whose manners she had in her early youth received the first impressions. her two uncles, the duke of aumale and the grand prior, with the other french nobility, soon took leave of her: the marquis of elbeuf remained some time longer; but after his departure, she was left to the society of her own subjects; men unacquainted with the pleasures of conversation, ignorant of arts and civility, and corrupted, beyond their usual rusticity, by a dismal fanaticism, which rendered them incapable of all humanity or improvement. though mary had made no attempt to restore the ancient religion, her popery was a sufficient crime: though her behavior was hitherto irreproachable, and her manners sweet and engaging, her gayety and ease were interpreted as signs of dissolute vanity. and to the harsh and preposterous usage which this princess met with may, in part, be ascribed those errors of her subsequent conduct which seemed so little of a piece with the general tenor of her character.

there happened to the marquis of elbeuf, before his departure, an adventure which, though frivolous, might enable him to give mary's friends in france a melancholy idea of her situation. this nobleman, with the earl of bothwell and some other young courtiers, had been engaged, after a debauch, to pay a visit to a woman called alison craig, who was known to be liberal of her favors; and because they were denied admittance, they broke the windows, thrust open the door, and committed some disorders in searching for the damsel. it happened that the assembly of the church was sitting at that time, and they immediately took the matter under their cognizance. in conjunction with several of the nobility, they presented an address to the queen, which was introduced with this awful prelude: ""to the queen's majesty, and to her secret and great council, her grace's faithful and obedient subjects, the professors of christ jesus's holy evangil, wish the spirit of righteous judgment."" the tenor of the petition was that the fear of god, the duty which they owed her grace, and the terrible threatenings denounced by god against every city or country where horrible crimes were openly committed, compelled them to demand the severe punishment of such as had done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of god against the whole realm; that the iniquity of which they complained was so heinous and so horrible that they should esteem themselves accomplices in it, if they had been engaged by worldly fear, or servile complaisance, to pass it over in silence, or bury it in oblivion: that as they owed her grace obedience, in the administration of justice, so were they entitled to require of her, in return, the sharp and condign punishment of this enormity, which, they repeated it, might draw down the vengeance of god on the whole kingdom: and that they maintained it to be her duty to lay aside all private affections towards the actors in so heinous a crime, and so enormous a villany, and without delay bring them to a trial, and inflict the severest penalty upon them. the queen gave a gracious reception to his peremptory address, but because she probably thought that breaking the windows of a brothel merited not such severe reprehension, she only replied, that her uncle was a stranger, and that he was attended by a young company; but she would put such order to him and to all others that her subjects should henceforth have no reason to complain. her passing over this incident so slightly was the source of great discontent, and was regarded as a proof of the most profligate manners.

it is not to be omitted, that alison craig, the cause of all the uproar was known to entertain a commerce with the earl of arran, who, on account of his great zeal for the reformation, was, without scruple, indulged in that enormity.

some of the populace of edinburgh broke into the queen's chapel during her absence, and committed outrages; for which two of them were indicted, and it was intended to bring them to a trial. knox wrote circular letters to the most considerable zealots of the party, and charged them to appear in town and protect their brethren. the holy sacraments, he there said, are abused by profane papists; the mass has been said; and in worshipping that idol, the priests have omitted no ceremony, not even the conjuring of their accursed water, that had ever been practised in the time of the greatest blindness. these violent measures for opposing justice were little short of rebellion; and knox was summoned before the council to answer for his offence. the courage of the man was equal to his insolence. he scrupled not to tell the queen that the pestilent papists who had inflamed her against these holy men were the sons of the devil; and must therefore obey the directions of their father, who had been a liar and a manslayer from the beginning. the matter ended with the full acquittal of knox. randolph, the english ambassador in scotland, had reason to write to cecil, speaking of the scottish nation, ""i think marvellously of the wisdom of god, that gave this unruly, inconstant, and cumbersome people no more power nor substance; for they would otherwise run wild.""

we have related these incidents at greater length than the necessity of our subject may seem to require; but even trivial circumstances, which show the manners of the age, are often more instructive, as well as entertaining, than the great transactions of wars and negotiations, which are nearly similar in all periods and in all countries of the world.

the reformed clergy in scotland had at that time a very natural reason for their ill humor; namely, the poverty, or rather beggary, to which they were reduced. the nobility and gentry had at first laid their hands on all the property of the regular clergy, without making any provision for the friars and nuns, whom they turned out of their possessions. the secular clergy of the catholic communion, though they lost all ecclesiastical jurisdiction, still held some of the temporalities of their benefices; and either became laymen themselves and converted them into private property, or made conveyance of them at low prices to the nobility, who thus enriched themselves by the plunder of the church. the new teachers had hitherto subsisted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the faithful; and in a poor country, divided in religious sentiments, this establishment was regarded as very scanty and very precarious. repeated applications were made for a legal settlement to the preachers; and though almost every thing in the kingdom was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was with difficulty that their request was at last complied with. the fanatical spirit which they indulged, and their industry in decrying the principles and practices of the romish communion, which placed such merit in enriching the clergy, proved now a very sensible obstacle to their acquisitions. the convention, however, passed a vote, by which they divided all the ecclesiastical benefices into twenty-one shares: they assigned fourteen to the ancient possessors: of the remaining seven they granted three to the crown; and if that were found to answer the public expenses, they bestowed the overplus on the reformed ministers. the queen was empowered to levy all the seven; and it was ordained that she should afterwards pay to the clergy what should be judged to suffice for their maintenance. the necessities of the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, and the small affection which mary bore to the protestant ecclesiastics, rendered their revenues contemptible as well as uncertain; and the preachers, finding that they could not rival the gentry, or even the middling rank of men, in opulence and plenty, were necessitated to betake themselves to other expedients for supporting their authority. they affected a furious zeal for religion, morose manners, a vulgar and familiar, yet mysterious can't; and though the liberality of subsequent princes put them afterwards on a better footing with regard to revenue, and thereby corrected in some degree those bad habits, it must be confessed that, while many other advantages attend presbyterian government, these inconveniences are not easily separated from the genius of that ecclesiastical polity.

the queen of scots, destitute of all force, possessing a narrow revenue, surrounded with a factious, turbulent nobility, a bigoted people, and insolent ecclesiastics, soon found that her only expedient for maintaining tranquillity was to preserve a good correspondence with elizabeth, who, by former connections and services, had acquired such authority over all these ranks of men.

        * jebb, vol. ii. p. 456.

soon after her arrival in scotland, secretary lidington was sent to london, in order to pay her compliments to the queen, and express her desire of friendship and a good correspondence; and he received a commission from her, as well as from the nobility of scotland, to demand, as a means of cementing this friendship, that mary should, by act of parliament or by proclamation, (for the difference between these securities was not then deemed very considerable,) be declared successor to the crown. no request could be more unreasonable, or made at a more improper juncture. the queen replied, that mary had once discovered her intention not to wait for the succession, but had openly, without ceremony or reserve, assumed the title of queen of england, and had pretended a superior right to her throne and kingdom: that though her ambassadors and those of her husband, the french king, had signed a treaty, in which they renounced that claim, and promised satisfaction for so great an indignity, she was so intoxicated with this imaginary right, that she had rejected the most earnest solicitations, and even, as some endeavored to persuade her, had incurred some danger, in crossing the seas, rather than ratify that equitable treaty: that her partisans every where had still the assurance to insist on her title, and had presumed to talk of her own birth as illegitimate: that while affairs were on this footing; while a claim thus openly made, so far from being openly renounced, was only suspended till a more favorable opportunity; it would in her be the most egregious imprudence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown by declaring her the successor: that no expedient could be worse imagined for cementing friendship than such a declaration; and kings were often found to bear no good will to their successors, even though their own children; much more when the connection was less intimate, and when such cause of disgust and jealousy had already been given, and indeed was still continued, on the part of mary: that though she was willing, from the amity which she bore her kinswoman, to ascribe her former pretensions to the advice of others, by whose direction she was then governed, her present refusal to relinquish them could proceed only from her own prepossessions, and was a proof that she still harbored some dangerous designs against her: that it was the nature of all men to be disgusted with the present, to entertain flattering views of futurity, to think their services ill rewarded, to expect a better recompense from the successor; and she should esteem herself scarcely half a sovereign over the english, if they saw her declare her heir, and arm her rival with authority against her own repose and safety: that she knew the inconstant nature of the people; she was acquainted with the present divisions in religion; she was not ignorant that the same party, which expected greater favor during the reign of mary, did also imagine that the title of that princess was superior to her own: that for her part, whatever claims were advanced, she was determined to live and die queen of england; and after her death it was the business of others to examine who had the best pretensions, either by the laws or by right of blood, to the succession: that she hoped the claim of the queen of scots would then be found solid; and, considering the injury which she herself had received, it was sufficient indulgence if she promised, in the mean time, to do nothing which might in any respect weaken or invalidate it: and that mary, if her title were really preferable—a point which, for her own part, she had never inquired into—possessed all advantages above her rivals; who, destitute both of present power and of all support by friends, would only expose themselves to inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even doubtful pretensions.

these views of the queen were so prudent and judicious, that there was no likelihood of her ever departing from them: but that she might put the matter to a fuller proof, she offered to explain the words of the treaty of edinburgh, so as to leave no suspicion of their excluding mary's right of succession; and in this form she again required her to ratify that treaty. matters at last came to this issue, that mary agreed to the proposal, and offered to renounce all present pretensions to the crown of england, provided elizabeth would agree to declare her the successor. but such was the jealous character of this latter princess, that she never would consent to strengthen the interest and authority of any claimant by fixing the succession; much less would she make this concession in favor of a rival queen, who possessed such plausible pretensions for the present, and who, though she might verbally renounce them, could easily resume her claim on the first opportunity.

mary's proposal, however, bore so specious an appearance of equity and justice, that elizabeth, sensible that reason would, by superficial thinkers, be deemed to lie entirely on that side, made no more mention of the matter; and though further concessions were never made by either princess, they put on all the appearances of a cordial reconciliation and friendship with each other.

the queen observed that, even without her interposition, mary was sufficiently depressed by the mutinous spirit of her own subjects; and instead of giving scotland for the present any inquietude or disturbance, she employed herself, more usefully and laudably, in regulating the affairs of her own kingdom, and promoting the happiness of her people. she made some progress in paying those great debts which lay upon the crown; she regulated the coin, which had been much debased by her predecessors; she furnished her arsenals with great quantities of arms from germany and other places; engaged her nobility and gentry to imitate her example in this particular; introduced into the kingdom the art of making gunpowder and brass cannon; fortified her frontiers on the side of scotland; made frequent reviews of the militia; encouraged agriculture, by allowing a free exportation of corn; promoted trade and navigation; and so much increased the shipping of her kingdom, both by building vessels of force herself, and suggesting like undertakings to the merchants, that she was justly styled the restorer of naval glory, and the queen of the northern seas. the natural frugality of her temper, so far from incapacitating her for these great enterprises, only enabled her to execute them with greater certainty and success; and all the world, saw in her conduct the happy effects of a vigorous perseverance in judicious and well-concerted projects.

        * camden, p. 388. strype, vol. i. p. 230, 336, 337.

it is easy to imagine that so great a princess, who enjoyed such singular felicity and renown, would receive proposals of marriage from every one that had any likelihood of succeeding; and though she had made some public declarations in favor of a single life, few believed that she would persevere forever in that resolution. the archduke charles, second son of the emperor, as well as casimir, son of the elector palatine, made applications to her; and as this latter prince professed the reformed religion, he thought himself, on that account, better entitled to succeed in his addresses. eric, king of sweden, and adolph, duke of holstein, were encouraged by the same views to become suitors: and the earl of arran, heir to the crown of scotland, was, by the states of that kingdom, recommended to her as a suitable marriage.

        * haynes, vol. i. p. 233.

even some of her own subjects, though they did not openly declare their pretensions, entertained hopes of success. the earl of arundel, a person declining in years, but descended from an ancient and noble family, as well as possessed of great riches, flattered himself with this prospect; as did also sir william pickering, a man much esteemed for his personal merit. but the person most likely to succeed, was a younger son of the late duke of northumberland, lord robert dudley, who, by means of his exterior qualities, joined to address and flattery, had become in a manner her declared favorite, and had great influence in all her counsels. the less worthy he appeared of this distinction, the more was his great favor ascribed to some violent affection, which could thus seduce the judgment of this penetrating princess; and men long expected that he would obtain the preference above so many princes and monarchs. but the queen gave all these suitors a gentle refusal, which still encouraged their pursuit; and thought that she should the better attach them to her interest, if they were still allowed to entertain hopes of succeeding in their pretensions. it is also probable that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture of female coquetry; and that, though she was determined in her own mind never to share her power with any man, she was not displeased with the courtship, solicitation, and professions of love, which the desire of acquiring so valuable a prize procured her from all quarters.

what is most singular in the conduct and character of elizabeth is, that though she determined never to have any heir of her own body, she was not only very averse to fix any successor to the crown, but seems, also, to have resolved, as far as it lay in her power, that no one who had pretensions to the succession should ever have any heirs or successors. if the exclusion given by the will of henry viii. to the posterity of margaret, queen of scotland, was allowed to be valid, the right to the crown devolved on the house of suffolk; and the lady catharine gray, younger sister to the lady jane, was now the heir of that family. this lady had been married to lord herbert, son of the earl of pembroke; but having been divorced from that nobleman, she had made a private marriage with the earl of hertford, son of the protector; and her husband, soon after consummation, travelled into france. in a little time she appeared to be pregnant, which so enraged elizabeth, that she threw her into the tower, and summoned hertford to appear, in order to answer for his misdemeanor. he made no scruple of acknowledging the marriage, which, though concluded without the queen's consent, was entirely suitable to both parties; and for this offence he was also committed to the tower. elizabeth's severity stopped not here: she issued a commission to inquire into the matter; and as hertford could not, within the time limited, prove the nuptials by witnesses, the commerce between him and his consort was declared unlawful, and their posterity illegitimate. they were still detained in custody, but by bribing their keepers, they found means to have further intercourse; and another child appeared to be the fruit of their commerce. this was a fresh source of vexation to the queen; who made a fine of fifteen thousand pounds be set on hertford by the star chamber and ordered his confinement to be thenceforth more rigid and severe. he lay in this condition for nine years, till the death of his wife, by freeing elizabeth from all fears, procured him his liberty. this extreme severity must be accounted for, either by the unrelenting jealousy of the queen, who was afraid lest a pretender to the succession should acquire credit by having issue; or by her malignity, which, with all her great qualities, made one ingredient in her character, and which led her to envy in others those natural pleasures of love and posterity, of which her own ambition and desire of dominion made her renounce all prospect for herself.

there happened, about this time, some other events in the royal family where the queen's conduct was more laudable. arthur pole and his brother, nephews to the late cardinal, and descended from the duke of clarence, together with anthony fortescue, who had married a sister of these gentlemen, and some other persons, were brought to their trial for intending to withdraw into france, with a view of soliciting succors from the duke of guise, of returning thence into wales, and of proclaiming mary queen of england, and arthur pole duke of clarence. they confessed the indictment, but asserted that they never meant to execute these projects during the queen's lifetime: they had only deemed such precautions requisite in case of her demise, which some pretenders to judicial astrology had assured them they might with certainty look for before the year expired. they were condemned by the jury; but received a pardon from the queen's clemency.

let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
will you even look back when you think of me?


all i want is a place to call my own
to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
keep your hopes up high and your head down low


still got something left to prove
it tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says
my last days are looming overhead
but just what the hell do they think they know?
i keep my head above the water, while they drown in the undertow


let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
will you even look back when you think of me?


all i want is a place to call my own
to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
all i want is a place to call my own
to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low


if you take it from me, live your life for yourself
cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
c'mon!


so let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
i get what i want so everyone's always judging me
i'm not afraid of anything, i've got the whole world in front of me


all i want is a place to call my own
to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
all i want is a place to call my own
to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low


keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low

Bite the Pain|Death|metal|"look down at the body
you may see no trace of wounds
but in the eye
the eye of the beholder
one cannot assume

not a drop of blood is drawn
but you know how it bleeds
beware of the sharp edged weapon
called human being

it is a shield of passion
and strong will
from this i am the victor
instead of the kill

i will not feed your hunger
instead, i bite the pain
looking not back, but forward
i bite down
try to cover up the trail of deceit
and daggers spawned from your soul

acid, the tears of remorse
flow in vain, too late for regrets
save it
for the next ill-fated game

from this i am the victor

Stand Up And Fight|Turisas|metal|"
the pouring rain
sticks my hair to my face
an empty gaze
is all that i have left
the stars that once led my way
have dimmed
the sky turned gray
the path once so clear
faded away

blessed are the days
when life is intent and clear
no falter or doubt
i know the way
they are the days i hope
that i never stepped on this road
the spark i once had
seems to have died


stand up and fight!
stand up and look into the light
pushing the clouds away

stand up and fight!
stand up and see the sky turn bright
fight for a better day


what a relief it would be
to end this all
how easy to fly the white flag
and give up
but would i run today
just to die another day?
give up now and every fight
has been in vain



get up! you've made it this far!
no loser you are!
one more time!
one more try!

watching the mortals ""discovering"" my chronicles
guarded by the old demons
even unknown to me

once destroyed their souls are being summoned
to my timeless prison of hate
it is delightful to feast upon the screaming souls
that were destroyed in my future

life betrayal - a warping rage
evil ripping caverns through your mind
immolation - in blood you've signed your soul away
sickening life ends but the horror has just begun


vultures moaning a funeral dirge
walls await to cradle you and rip your soul apart
incessant screaming echoes through the maze
insanity approaches - imminent demise

stricken from the holy book deliverance to pain
effigy of jesus christ burning in your mind
voices cry out to bid you welcome
locked within the dungeons of darkness - no escape!!

passing through corridors embedded with
scars of those who have gone before you

warning comes too late to save you now
visions of suffering stab from the inside

you pray for death
mourning does no good as you can only die once
souls are being raped by the maze
lost in these halls, endlessly

Storming Through Red Clouds And Holocaust Winds|Immortal|metal|"argument.

the siege of carduel—the preparations of the saxon host for the final assault on the city, under cover of the approaching night—the state of carduel—discord—despondence—famine—the apparent impossibility to resist the coming enemy—dialogue between caradoc and merlin—caradoc hears his sentence, and is resigned—he unstrings his harp and descends into the town—the progress of song; in its effects upon the multitude—caradoc’s address to the people he has roused, and the rush to the council hall—meanwhile the saxons reach the walls—the burst of the cymrians—the saxons retire into the plain between the camp and the city, and there take their stand—the battle described—the single combat between lancelot and harold—crida leads on his reserve; the cymrians take alarm and waver—the prediction invented by the noble devotion of caradoc—his fate—the enthusiasm of the cymrians and the retreat of the enemy to their camp—the first entrance of a happy soul into heaven—the ghost that appears to arthur, and leads him through the cimmerian tomb to tbe realm of death—the sense of time and space are annihilated—death, the phantasmal everywhere—its brevity and nothingness—the condition of soul is life, whether here or hereafter—fate and nature identical—arthur accosted by his guardian angel—after the address of that angel, arthur loses his former fear both of the realm and the phantom—he addresses the ghost, which vanishes without reply to his question—the last boon—the destined soother—arthur recovering as from a trance, sees the maiden of the tomb—her description—the dove is beheld no more—strange resemblance between the maiden and the dove—arthur is led to his ship, and sails at once for carduel—he arrives on the cymrian territory, and lands with gawaine and the maiden near carduel, amidst the ruins of a hamlet devastated by the saxons—he seeks a convent, of which only one tower, built by the romans, remains—from the hill top he surveys the walls of carduel and the saxon encampment—the appearance of the holy abbess, who recognises the king, and conducts him and his companions to the subterranean grottoes built by the romans for a summer retreat—he leaves the maiden to the care of the abbess, and concerts with gawaine the scheme for attack on the saxons—the virgin is conducted to the cell of the abbess—her thoughts and recollections, which explain her history—her resolution—she attempts to escape—meets the abbess, who hangs the cross round her neck, and blesses her—she departs to the saxon camp.

i.
king crida’s hosts are storming carduel!
from vale to mount one world of armour shines,
round castled piles·for which the forest fell,
spreads the white war-town of the teuton lines;
to countless clarions, countless standards swell;
king crida’s hosts are storming carduel!

ii.
there, all its floods the saxon deluge pours;
all the fierce tribes; from those whose fathers first
with their red seaxes from the southward shores,
carved realms for hengist,—to the bands that burst
along the humber, on the idle wall
rome built for manhood rotted by her thrall.

iii.
there, wild allies from many a kindred race,
in cymrian lands hail teuton thrones to be:
dark jutland wails her absent populace,—
and large-limbed sons, his waves no more shall see,
leave danube desolate: afar they roam,
where halts the raven there to find a home.

iv.
within the inmost fort the pine-trees made,
the hardy women kneel to warrior gods.
for where the saxon armaments invade,
all life abandons their resigned abodes.
all that they prize the tents they pitch contain;
and each new march is for a new domain.

v.
to the stern gods the fair-haired women kneel,
as slow to rest the red sun glides along;
and near and far, hammers, and clanking steel,
neighs from impatient barbs, and runic song
mutter’d o’er mystic fires by wizard priests,
invite the valkyrs to the raven feasts.

vi.
for after nine long moons of siege and storm,
thy hold, pendragon, trembles to its fall!
loftier the roman tower uprears its form,
from the crushed bastion and the shattered wall,
and but till night those iron floods delay
their rush of thunder:—blood-red sinks the day.

vii.
death halts to strike, and swift the moment flies:
within the walls, (than all without more fell,)
discord with babel tongues confounds the wise,
and spectral panic, like a form of hell
chased by a fury, fleets,—or, palsied, stands
dull-eyed despondence, wringing nerveless hands.

viii.
and pride, that evil angel of the celt,
whispers to all, “’tis servile to obey,”
robs ordered union of its starry belt,
rends chief from chief and tribe from tribe away,
and leaves the children wrangling for command
round the wild death-throes of the father-land.

ix.
in breadless marts, the ill-persuading fiend
famine, stalks maddening with her wolfish stare;
and hearts, on whose stout anchors faith had leaned,
bound at her look to treason from despair,
shouting, “why shrink we from the saxon’s thrall?
is slavery worse than famine smiting all?”

x.
thus in the absence of the sunlike king,
all phantoms stalk abroad; dissolve and droop
light and the life of nations—while the wing
of carnage halts but for its rushing swoop.
some moan, some rave, some laze the hours away;—
and down from carduel blood-red sunk the day!

xi.
leaning against a broken parapet
alone with thought, mused caradoc the bard,
when a voice smote him, and he turned and met
a gaze prophetic in its sad regard.
beside him, solemn with his hundred years,
stood the arch hierarch of the cymrian seers.

xii.
“dost thou remember,” said the sage, “that hour
when, seeking signs to glory’s distant way,
thou heard’st the night-bird in her leafy bower,
singing sweet death-chaunts to her shining prey,
while thy young poet-heart, with ravished breath,
hung on the music, nor divined the death?”

xiii.
“ay,” the bard answer’d, “and ev’n now, methought,
i heard again the ambrosial melody!”
“so,” sighed the prophet, “to the bard, unsought,
come the far whispers of futurity!
like his own harp, his soul a wind can thrill,
and the chord murmur, tho’ the hand be still.

xiv.
“wilt thou for ever, evën from the tomb,
live, yet a music, in the hearts of all;
arise and save thy country from its doom;
arise, immortal, at the angel’s call!
the hour shall give thee all thy life implored,
and make the lyre more glorious than the sword.

xv.
“in vain, thro’ yon dull stupour of despair,
sound geraint’s tromp and owaine’s battle-cry;
in vain where yon rude clamour storms the air,
the council chiefs stem mad’ning mutiny;
from trystan’s mail the lion heart is gone,
and on the breach stands lancelot alone!

xvi.
“driveling the wise, and impotent the strong;
fast into night the life of freedom dies;
awake light-bringer, wake bright soul of song,
kindler, reviver, re-creator, rise!
crown thy great mission with thy parting breath,
and teach to hosts the bard’s disdain of death!”

xvii.
thrilled at that voice the soul of caradoc;
he heard, and knew his glory and his doom.
as when in summer’s noon the lightning shock
smites some fair elm in all its pomp of bloom,
mid whose green boughs each vernal breeze had played,
and air’s sweet race melodious homes had made;

xviii.
so that young life bowed sad beneath the stroke
that seared the fresh and stilled the musical,
yet on the sadness thought sublimely broke:
holy the tree on which the bolt doth fall!
wild flowers shall spring the sacred roots around,
and nightly fairies tread the haunted ground;

xix.
there, age by age, shall youth with musing brow,
hear legend murmuring of the days of yore;
there, virgin love more lasting deem the vow
breathed in the shade of branches green no more;
and kind religion keep the grand decay
still on the earth while forests pass away.

xx.
“so be it, o voice from heaven,” the bard replied,
“some grateful tears may yet embalm my name,
ever for human love my youth hath sighed,
and human love’s divinest form is fame.
is the dream erring? shall the song remain?
say, can one poet ever live in vain?”

xxi.
as the warm south on some unfathomed sea,
along the magian’s soul, the awful rest
stirred with the soft emotion: tenderly
he laid his hand upon the brows he blessed,
and said, “complete beneath a brighter sun
the beautiful life which here was but begun.

xxii.
“joyous and light, and fetterless thro’ all
the blissful, infinite, empyreal space,
if then thy spirit stoopeth to recall
the ray it shed upon the human race,
see where the ray had kindled from the dearth,
seeds that shall glad the garners of the earth!

xxiii.
“never true poet lived and sung in vain:
lost if his name, and withered if his wreath,
the thoughts he woke must evermore remain
fused in our light and blended with our breath;
all life more noble, and all earth more fair,
because that soul refined man’s common air!”*

xxiv.
then rose the bard, and smilingly unstrung
his harp of ivory sheen, from shoulders broad,
kissing the hand that doomed his life, he sprung
light from the shattered wall,—and swiftly strode
where, herdlike huddled in the central space,
drooped, in dull pause, the cowering populace.

xxv.
there, in the midst he stood!   the heavens were pale
with the first stars, unseen amidst the glare
cast from large pine-brands on the sullen mail
of listless legions, and the streaming hair
of women, wailing for the absent dead,
or bowed o’er infant lips that moaned for bread.

xxvi.
from out the illumed cathedral hollowly
swelled, like a dirge, the hymn; and thro’ the throng
whose looks had lost all commerce with the sky,
with lifted rood the slow monks swept along,
and vanished hopeless: from those wrecks of man
fled ev’n religion:—then the bard began.

xxvii.
slow, pitying, soft it glides, the liquid lay,
sad with the burthen of the singer’s soul;
into the heart it coiled its lulling way;
wave upon wave the golden river stole;
hushed to his feet forgetful famine crept,
and woe, reviving, veiled the eyes that wept.

xxviii.
then stern, and harsh, clashed the ascending strain,
telling of ills more dismal yet in store;
rough with the iron of the grinding chain,
dire with the curse of slavery evermore;
wild shrieks from lips beloved pale warriors hear,
her child’s last death-groan rends the mother’s ear;

xxix.
then trembling hands instinctive griped the swords;
and men unquiet sought each other’s eyes;
loud into pomp sonorous swell the chords,
like linkëd legions march the melodies;
till the full rapture swept the bard along,
and o’er the listeners rushed the storm of song:

xxx.
and the dead spoke; from cairns and kingly graves
the heroes called;—and saints from earliest shrines;
and the land spoke!—mellifluous river-waves;
dim forests awful with the roar of pines;
mysterious caves from legend-haunted deeps;
and torrents flashing from untrodden steeps;—

xxxi.
the land of freedom called upon the free!
all nature spoke; the clarions of the wind;
the organ swell of the majestic sea;
the choral stars; the universal mind
spoke, like the voice from which the world began,
“no chain for nature and the soul of man!”

xxxii.
then loud thro’ all, as if mankind’s reply,
burst from the bard the cymrian battle hymn!
that song which swelled the anthems of the sky,
the alleluia of the seraphim;
when saints led on the children of the lord,
and smote the heathen with the angel’s sword.

xxxiii.
as leaps the warfire on the beacon hills,
leapt in each heart the lofty flame divine;
as into sunlight flash the molten rills,
flasht the glad claymores, lightening line on line;
from cloud to cloud as thunder speeds along,
from rank to rank—rushed forth the choral song.—

xxxiv.
woman and child—all caught the fire of men,
to its own heaven that alleluia rang,
life to the spectres had returned agen;
and from the grave an armëd nation sprang!
then spoke the bard,—each crest its plumage bowed,
as the large voice went lengthening thro’ the crowd.

xxxv.
“hark to the measured march!—the saxons come!
the sound earth quails beneath the hollow tread!
your fathers rushed upon the swords of rome
and climbed her war-ships—when the cæsar fled:
the saxons come! why wait within the wall?
they scale the mountain:—let its torrents fall!

xxxvi.
“mark, ye have swords, and shields, and armour, ye!
no mail defends the cymrian child of song,
but where the warrior—there the bard shall be!
all fields of glory to the bard belong!
his realm extends wherever god-like strife
spurns the base death, and wins immortal life.

xxxvii.
“unarmed he goes—his guard the shields of all,
where he bounds foremost on the saxon spear!
unarmed he goes, that, falling, ev’n his fall
shall bring no shame, and shall bequeath no fear!
does his song cease?—avenge it by the deed,
and make his sepulchre—a nation freed!”

xxxviii.
he said, and where the chieftains wrangling sate,
led the grand army marshalled by his song;
into the hall—and on the wild debate,
king of all kings, a people, poured along;
and from the heart of man the trumpet cry
smote faction down, “arms, arms and liberty!”

xxxix.
meanwhile rolled on the saxon’s long array;
on to the wall the surge of slaughter rolled;
slow up the mount—slow heaved its awful way;
the moonlight rested on the domes of gold;
no warder peals alarum from the keep,
and death comes mute, as on the realm of sleep;

xl.
when, as their ladders touched the ruined wall,
and to the van, high-towering, harold strode,
sudden expand the brazen-gates, and all
the awful arch as with the lava glowed;
torch upon torch the dreadful sweep illumes,
the burst of armour and the flash of plumes!

xli.
rings owaine’s shout;—rings geraint’s thunder-cry;
the saxon’s death-knell in a hundred wars;
and cador’s laugh of joy;—rush through the sky
bright tossing banderolls—swift as shooting stars.—
trystan’s white lion—lancelot’s cross of red,
and tudor’s standard with the saxon’s head.

xlii.
and high o’er all, its scalëd splendour rears
the vengeful emblem of the dragon kings.
full on the saxon bursts the storm of spears;
far down the vale the charging whirlwind rings;
while, thro’ the ranks its barbëd knighthood clave,
all carduel follows with its roaring wave.

xliii.
and ever in the van, with robes of white
and ivory harp, shone swordless caradoc;
and ever floated, in melodious might,
the clear song buoyant o’er the battle shock;
calm as an eagle, when the olympian king
sends the red bolt upon its tranquil wing.

xliv.
borne back, and wedged within the ponderous weight
of their own dense and multitudinous crowd,
recoiled the saxons!   as adown the height
of some grey mountain, rolls the cloven cloud,
smit by the shafts of the resistless day,—
so to the vale sunk dun the rent array.

xlv.
midway between the camp and carduel,
halting their slow retreat, the saxons stood;
there as the sea arabian ere it fell
on ægypt’s chariots, gathered up the flood;
there, in suspended deluge, solid rose,
and hung expectant o’er the hurrying foes.

xlvi.
right in the centre, rampired round with shields,
king crida stood,—o’er him, its livid mane
the horse whose pasture is the valkyr’s fields
flung wide;—but, foremost thro’ the javelin-rain,
blazed harold’s helm, as when, thro’ all the stars
distinct, pale soothsayers see the dooming mars.

xlvii.
down dazzling sweeps the cymrian chivalry
round the bright sweep closes the saxon wall;
snatcht from the glimmer of the funeral sky,
raves the blind murder; and enclasped with all
its own stern hell, against the iron bar
pants the fierce heart of the imprisoned war.

xlviii.
only by gleaming banners and the flash
of some large sword, the vext obscure once more
sparkled to light.   in one tumultuous crash
merged every sound—as when the maëlstrom’s roar
by dire lofoden, dulls the seaman’s groan,
and drowns the voice of tempests in its own.

xlix.
the cymrian ranks,—disparted from their van,
and their hemmed horsemen,—stubborn, but in vain,
press thro’ the levelled spears; yet, man by man,
and shield to shield close-serried, they sustain
the sleeting hail against them hurtling sent,
from every cloud in that dread armament.

l.
but now, at length, cleaving the solid clang,
and o’er the dead men in their frowning sleep,
the rallying shouts of chiefs confronted rang
“thor and walhalla!”—answered swift and deep
by “allleluia!” and thy chaunted cry,
young bard sublime, “for christ and liberty!”

li.
then the ranks opened, and the midnight moon
streamed where the battle, like the scornful main,
ebbed from the dismal wrecks its wrath had strewn.
paused either host;—lo, in the central plain
two chiefs had met, and in that breathless pause,
each to its champion left a nation’s cause.

lii.
now, heaven defend thee, noble lancelot!
for never yet such danger thee befell,—
tho’ loftier deeds than thine emblazon not
the peerless twelve of golden carduel,
tho’ oft thy breast hath singly stemmed a field,—
as when thy falchion clashed on harold’s shield!

liii.
and lancelot knew not his majestic foe,
save by his deeds; by cador’s cloven crest;
by modred’s corpse; by rills of blood below,
and shrinking helms above;—when from the rest
spurring,—the steel of his uplifted brand
drew down the lightning of that red right hand.

liv.
full on the saxon’s shield the sword descends;
the strong shield clattering shivers at the stroke,
and the bright crest with all its plumage bends,
as to the blast with all its boughs an oak:
as from the blast an oak retowering slow,
the crest remounts, and overshades the foe.

lv.
now, grasped with both hands, o’er the christian hung
the axe that woden taught his sons to wield;
slant from the death-blow lancelot’s charger sprung
and cymri sees its champion fly the field.
feigns he to fly, but to renew, the strife?
or holds he honour of less worth than life?

lvi.
“lo, saxons, what chiefs these walloons lead!”
laughed hollow from his helm the scornful thane.
then tow’rds less recreant knights he spurred his steed,
when on his path rushed lancelot again.
thus, when awhile the falcon soars away,
‘tis but for deadlier swoop upon its prey:

lvii.
and as the falcon, while its talons dart
into the crane’s broad bosom, splits its own
on the sharp beak, and, clinging heart to heart,
both in one plumage blent, spin whirling down,—
so in that shock each found, and dealt, the blow;
rolled horse on horse; fell, grappling, foe on foe.

lviii.
first to his feet the slighter cymrian leapt,
and on the saxon’s breast set firm his knee;
then thro’ the heather host a shudder crept,
rose all their voices,—wild and wailingly;
“woe, harold, woe!” as from one bosom came,
the groan of thousands, and the mighty name.

lix.
the cymrian starts, and stays his lifted hand,
for at that name from harold’s vizor shone
genevra’s eyes!   back in its sheath the brand
he plunged:—rose harold—and the foe was gone,—
lost amid dust-clouds, big with arrowy rain,
where thickest grouped the slaughterers round the slain.

lx.
fast on his track spurred every cymrian knight,
again confused, the onslaught raged on high;
again the war-shout swelled above the fight,
again the chaunt “for christ and liberty,”
when, with fresh hosts unbreathed, the saxon king
forth from the wall of shields leapt thundering.

lxi.
behind the chief the dreadful godfanon
spread;—the pale horse went rushing down the wind.—
“on where the valkyrs rest o’er carduel, on!
on o’er the corpses to the wolf consigned!
on, that the pale horse, ere the night be o’er,
stalled in yon tower, may rest his hoofs of gore!”

lxii.
thus spoke the king, and all his hosts replied;
filled by his word and kindled by his look—
for helmless, with his grey hair straming wide,
he strided thro’ the spears;—the mountains shook—
shook the dim city—as that answer rang;
the fierce shout chiming to the buckler’s clang!

lxiii.
aghast, the cymrians see, like titan sons
new-born form earth,—leap forth the sudden bands:
as when the wind’s invisible tremour runs
thro’ corn-sheafs ripening for the reaper’s hands,
the glittering tumult undulating flows,
and the field quivers where the panic goes.

lxiv.
the christians waver—shrink—recoil—give way,
strike with weak hands amazed; half turn to flee;
in vain with knightly charge their chiefs delay
the hostile mass that rolls resistlessly;
and the pale hoofs, for aye, had trampled down
the cymrian freedom and the dragon crown,

lxv.
but for that arch preserver, under heaven,
of names and states, the bard! the hour was come
to prove the ends for which the lyre was given:—
each thought divine demands its martyrdom.
where round the central standard rallying flock
the dragon chiefs—paused and spoke caradoc:

lxvi.
“ye cymrian men!”   hushed at the calm sweet sound,
drooped the wild murmur, bowed the loftiest crest,
meekly the haughty paladins grouped round
the swordless hero with the mail-less breast,
whose front, serene amid the spears, had taught
to humbled force the chivalry of thought.

lxvii.
“ye cymrian men—from heus the guardian’s tomb
i speak the oracular promise of the past.
fear not the saxon!   till the judgment-doom,
free on their hills the dragon race shall last,
if from yon heathen, ye this night can save
one spot not wider than a single grave.

lxviii.
“for thus the antique prophecy decrees,—
‘when, where the pale horse crushes down the dead,
war’s many sons shall see one child of peace
grasp at the mane to fall beneath the tread—
there, where he falleth let his corpse remain,
there, bid the dragon rest above the slain;

lxix.
“there, let the steel-clad living watch the clay,
till on that spot the grave for it be made,—
and the pale horse shall melt in cloud away,
no stranger’s step the sacred mound invade:
a people’s life that single death shall save,
and all the land be hallowed by one grave.’

lxx.
“so be the guardian’s prophecy fulfilled!
advance the dragon, for the grave is mine.”
he ceased; while yet the silver accents thrilled
each mail-clad bosom, down the listening line
bounded his steed, and like an arrow went
his plume, swift glancing thro’ the armament;

lxxi.
on, thro’ the tempest, went it glimmering;
on, thro’ the rushing barbs and levelled spears;
on, where, far streaming o’er the teuton king,
its horrent pomp the ghastly standard rears;
on rushed to rescue all to whom his breath
lent what saves nations,—the disdain of death.

lxxii.
alike the loftiest knight and meanest man,
all the roused host, but now so panic-chilled,
all cymri once more as one cymrian,
with the last light of that grand spirit filled,
thro’ rank on rank, down-mowed, down-trampled, sped,
and reached the standard—to defend the dead.

lxxiii.
wrenched from the heathen’s hand, one moment, bowed
in the bright christian’s grasp, the gonfanon;
then from a dumb amaze the countless crowd
woke,—and the night, as with a sudden sun,
flashed with avenging steel; life gained its goal,
and calm from lips proud-smiling went the soul!

lxxiv.
leapt from his selle, the king-born lancelot;
leapt from the selle each paladin and knight;
in one mute sign that, where upon that spot
the foot was planted, god forbade the flight:
there, should the father-land avenge its son,
or heap all cymri round the grave of one.

lxxv.
then, well nigh side by side—broad floated forth
the cymrian dragon and the teuton steed,
the rival powers that struggle for the north;
the gory idol—the chivalric creed;
odin’s and christ’s confronting flags unfurled,
as which should save and which destroy a world:

lxxvi.
then fought those cymrian men, as if on each
all cymri set its last undaunted hope;
thro’ the steel bulwarks round them yawns the breach;
vistas to freedom brightning onwards ope;
crida in vain leads band on slaughtered band,
in vain unsparing smites dread harold’s hand;

lxxvii.
as the fierce pard, when in its headlong bound
on the wild bull, baffled by horns that gore,
shrinks back, and reddens, in retreat, the ground
with ebbing life-blood;—so recedes, before
its purposed victim, crida’s foiled array,
awed by the marvel of its own dismay.

lxxviii.
“some god more mighty than walhalla’s king
strikes in yon arms”—the sullen murmurs run,
and fast and faster speeds the dragon wing—
and shrinks and cowers the ghastly gonfanon,
the panic gathers, and the pale horse flies;
lone rests the dragon under dawning skies!

lxxix.
lone rests the dragon, with its wings outspread
o’er one spot hallowed;—caradoc lies there;
and there kneel christian warriors round the dead,
with sobs that slowly vent themselves in prayer.
calm is the dead man’s smile as when he braved
hosts; and his altars and his land were saved.

lxxx.
pardon, ye shrouded and mysterious powers,
ye far-off shadows from the spirit-clime,
if, for that realm untrodden by the hours,
awhile we leave this lazar-house of time;
with song remounting to those native airs
of which, tho’ exiled, still we are the heirs.

lxxxi.
up from the clay and tow’rds the seraphim,
the immortal, men called caradoc, arose.
round the freed captive whose melodious hymn
had hailed each ray our earthly prison knows,
spread all the aisles by angel worship trod;
blazed every altar conscious of its god;

lxxxii.
all the illumed creation one calm shrine;
all space one rapt adoring ecstacy;
all the sweet stars, with their untroubled shine,
near and more near enlarging thro’ the sky;
all, opening gradual on the eternal sight,
joy after joy, the depths of their delight.

lxxxiii.
paused on the marge, heaven’s beautiful new-born,
paused on the marge of that wide happiness;
and as a lark that, poised amid the morn,
shakes from its wings the dews,—the plumes of bliss,
sunned in the dawn of the diviner birth,
shook every sorrow memory bore from earth:

lxxxiv.
knowledge, which on the troubled waves of sense
breaks into sparkles, poured upon the soul
its lambent, clear, translucent affluence,
and cold-eyed reason loosed its hard control;
each godlike guess beheld the truth it sought;
and inspiration flashed from what was thought.

lxxxv.
stilled evermore the old familiar train
of human motives prompting human deeds,
the unquiet race of the material brain,
formed for this life, and fashioned to its needs,
but without uses in that second birth,
when wakes in heaven the soul’s last sleep on earth.

lxxxvi.
greed and ambition, those misled desires
for bournes that fly us into worlds afar;
and carnal passion which with meteor fires
allures from lights in heaven; wisdom at war
with its own angel, faith;—that nurse of grief,
hope, crowned with flowers, a blight in every leaf;

lxxxvii.
all these are still—abandoned to the worm,
their loud breath jars not on the calm above:
only survived, as if the single germ
of the new life’s celestial essence,—love.
ah, if the bud can give such bloom to time,
what is the flower when in its native clime?

lxxxviii.
love to the radiant stranger left alone
of all the vanished hosts of memory;
while broadening round, on splendour splendour shone,
to earth soft-pitying dropt the veil-less eye,
and saw the shape, that love remembered still,
couched ’mid the ruins on the moonlit hill;

lxxxix.
and the freed spirit comprehending all
which to the labouring king had been ordained,
knew itself summoned, and obeyed the call,
to crown with peace the gifts thro’ conflict gained,
and to reveal, in arthur’s destined bride,
the lovely form concealed in duty’s guide.

xc.
pale to the slumbering king the shadow came,
its glory left it as the earth it neared,
in livid likeness as its corpse the same,
wan with its wounds the awful ghost appeared.
life heard the voice of unembodied breath,
and sleep stood trembling side by side with death.

xci.
“come,” said the voice, “before the iron gate
which hath no egress, waiting thee, behold
beside that power which is to matter—fate,
but not to soul,—the guide with locks of gold.”
then rose the mortal following, and, before,
moved the pale shape the angel’s comrade wore.

xcii.
where, in the centre of those ruins grey,
immense with blind walls columnless, a tomb
for earlier kings, whose names had passed away,
dusked the chill moonlight with its mass of gloom;
thro’ doors, ajar to every prying blast,
by which to rot imperial dust had past,

xciii.
the vision went, and went the living king;
then strange and hard to human ear to tell
by language moulded but by thoughts that bring
material images, what there befell!
the mortal entered eld’s dumb burial place,
and at the threshold, vanished time and space!

xciv.
yea, the hard sense of time was from the mind
rased and annihilate;—yea, space to eye
and soul was presenceless?   what rest behind?
thought and the infinite! the eternal i,
and its true realm the limitless, whose brink
thought ever nears: what bounds us when we think?

xcv.
“what,” asked the dreamer, “is this nothingness,
empty as air—yet air without a breath?”
answered the ghost—“tho’ it be measureless,
‘tis but that line ‘twixt life and life called ‘death,’
which souls, transported to a second birth,
pass in an instant when they soar from earth.

xcvi.
“from the brief here to the eternal there
we can but see the swift flash of the goal,
less than the space between two waves of air,
the void between existence and a soul;
wherefore look forth and with calm sight endure
the vague impalpable, inane obscure!

xcvii.
“lo, by the iron gate a giant cloud,
from which emerge (the form itself unseen,)
vast adamantine brows, sublimely bowed
over the dark—relentlessly serene;
that power called nature,—in this mortal state
is to all matter which is soulless, fate;

xcviii.
“issuing fixed laws which the brute world obey;
hiding the great law-giver of the whole;
nature saith not unto the lion ‘pray,’
nor to the lamb ‘look upward!’—in the soul
of man the supernatural lodged reveals
the god whom nature—matter’s fate—conceals.

xcix.
“and every work in which his sovran art
bows will-less nature to subserve his will,
and every instinct which compels his heart
to yearnings nature never can fulfil,
attest the future which to man is given
as earth’s sole creature that conceives a heaven.”

c.
while spoke the ghost, before the iron gate
sudden stood forth amidst the cloud whose gloom
mantled the form of nature throned as fate,
an image radiant with no mortal bloom,
its left hand bore a mirror, crystal-bright,
a wand star-pointed, glittered in the right.

ci.
“dost thou not know me?—me, thy second soul?
dost thou not know me, arthur?” said the voice;
“i who have led thee to each noble goal,
mirrored thy heart, and starward led thy choice?
to teach thee wisdom won in labour’s school,
i lured thy footsteps to the forest pool,

cii.
“shewed all the woes which wait inebriate power,
and woke the man from youth’s voluptuous dream;
glassed on the crystal—let each stainless hour
obey the wand i lift unto the beam;
and at the last, when yonder gates expand,
pass with thy guardian angel hand in hand.”

ciii.
spoke the sweet splendour, and, as music dies
into the heart that hears it, passed away,
then arthur lifted his serenest eyes
tow’rds the pale shade from the celestial day,
and said, “o thou in life beloved so well,
dream i or wake?—as those last accents fell,

civ.
“so fears that, spite of thy mild words, dismayed—
fears not of death, but that which death conceals,
vanish;—my soul that trembled at thy shade,
yearns to the far light which the shade reveals,
and sees how human is the dismal error
that hideth god, when veiling death with terror.

cv.
“ev’n thus some infant, in the early spring,
under the pale buds of the almond tree,
shrinks from the wind that, with an icy wing
shakes, showering down, white flakes that seem to be
winter’s wan sleet,—till the quick sunbeam shows
that those were blossoms which he took for snows.

cvi.
“thou, to this last supremest mystery
of my strange travail, as instructor sent,
dear as thou wert, i will not mourn for thee,
thou wert not shaped for earth’s hard element—
our ends, our aims, our pleasure and our woe,
thou knew’st them all, but thine we could not know.

cvii.
“forgive that none were worthy of thy worth!
that none took heed, upon their plodding way,
what diamond dew was on the flowers of earth,
till, in thy soul, drawn upward to the day.
but now, why gape the wounds upon thy breast?
what guilty hand dismissed thee to the blest?

cviii.
“for blest thou art, belov’d and lost?   oh, speak,
say thou art with the angels?”—as at night
far off, the pharos on the mountain-peak
sends o’er dim ocean one pale path of light,
lost in the wideness of the weltering sea,—
so, that one gleam along eternity

cix.
vouchsafed, heaven’s messenger (his mission closed)
fled; and the mortal stood amidst the cloud.
all dark above,—lo at his feet reposed
beneath the brows which over both were bowed,
with looks that lit the darkness where they smiled,
a virgin shape, half woman and half child!

cx.
there as if nature (call by that mild name
the power which but to soul-less things is fate),
had culled her choicest elements to frame
perfected beauty,—by the iron gate
the dreamer gazed upon the promised guide
thro’ life to death, his soul’s predestined bride.

cxi.
and as he gazed he thought to hear from far
the enchanter’s voice—“behold, transformed the dove!
in this last prize thy trials ended are:
no life completes itself that knows not love
as the soul knows it.”—here the morning beam
flashed on the dreamer and dispelled the dream.

cxii.
was it in truth a dream?   he gazed around,
and saw the granite of sepulchral walls;
thro’ open doors, along the desolate ground,
o’er coffined dust—the joyous sunshine falls,
revives the stir of insect life, and flings
a glory wasted on the tombs of kings.

cxiii.
he stood within that golgotha of old,
whither the phantom first had led the soul.
it was no dream! lo, round those locks of gold
rest the young sunbeams like an auriole;
lo, where the day night’s mystic promise keeps,
and in the tomb a life of beauty sleeps!

cxiv.
slow to his eyes, those lids reveal their own,
and, the lips smiling evën in their sigh,
the virgin woke.   o never yet was known,
in bower or pleasaunce under summer sky,
life so enriched with nature’s happiest bloom
as thine, thou young aurora of the tomb!

cxv.
words cannot paint thee, gentlest cynosure
of all things lovely in that loveliest form
souls wear—the youth of woman! brows as pure
as memphian skies that never knew a storm;
lips with such sweetness in their honied deeps
as fills the rose in which a fairy sleeps;

cxvi.
eyes on whose tenderest azure, aching hearts
might look as to a heaven, and cease to grieve;
the very blush, as day, when it departs,
haloes, in flushing, the mild cheek of eve,
taking soft warmth in light from earth afar,
heralds no thought less holy than a star.

cxvii.
and arthur spoke!   o ye, all noble souls,
divine how knighthood speaks to maiden fear!
yet, is it fear which that young heart controuls
and leaves its music voiceless on the ear?—
ye, who have felt what words can ne’er express,
say then, is fear as still as happiness?

cxviii.
by the mute pathos of an eloquent sign,
her rosy finger on her lip, the maid
seemed to denote that on that coral shrine
speech was to silence vowed.   then from the shade
gliding—she stood beneath the golden skies,
fair as the dawn that brightened paradise.

cxix.
and arthur looked, and saw the dove no more;
yet, by some wild and wondrous glamoury,
changed to the shape the new companion wore,
his soul the missing angel seemed to see;
and, soft and silent as the earlier guide,
the soft eyes thrill, the silent footsteps glide.

cxx.
thro’ paths his yester steps had failed to find,
adown the woodland slope she leads the king,—
and, pausing oft, she turns to look behind,
as oft had turned the dove upon the wing;
and oft he questioned, still to find reply
mute on the lip, yet struggling to the eye.

cxxi.
far briefer now the way, and open more
to heaven, than those his whilome steps had won;
and sudden, lo! his galley’s brazen prore
beams from the greenwood burnished in the sun;
up from the sward his watchful cruisers spring,
and loud-lipp’d welcome hails the genial king.

cxxii.
now plies the rapid oar, now swells the sail;
all day, and deep into the heart of night,
flies the glad bark before the favouring gale;
now sabra’s virgin waters dance in light
under the large full moon, on margents green,
lone with charred wrecks where saxon fires have been.

cxxiii.
here furls the sail, here rests awhile the oar,
and from the crews the cymrians and the maid
pass with hushed breath along the mournful shore;
for, where yon groves the gradual hillock shade,
a convent stood when arthur left the land.
god grant the shrine hath ’scap’d the heathen’s hand!

cxxiv.
as onward wends their way, thro’ roofless walls
and casement gaps, the ghost-like star-beams peer:
welcomed by night and ruin, hollow falls
the footstep of a king:—upon the ear
the inexpressible hush of murder lay,—
wide yawned the doors, and not a watch dog’s bay!

cxxv.
they pass the groves, they gain the holt, and, lo,
rests of the sacred pile but one grey tower,
a fort for luxury in the long-ago
of gentile gods, and rome’s voluptuous power.
but far, on walls yet spared, the moon-beams fell,—
far on the golden domes of carduel.

cxxvi.
“joy,” cried the king, “behold the land lives still!”
then gawaine pointed, where in lengthening line
the saxon watch-fires from the haunted hill,—
shorn of its forest old,—their blood-red shine
fling over isca, and with wrathful flush
gild the vast storm-cloud of the armëd hush.

cxxvii.
“ay,” said the king, “in that lulled massacre
doth no ghost whisper crida—‘sleep no more!’
hark, where i stand, dark murder-chief, on thee
i launch the doom! ye airs, that wander o’er
ruins and graveless bones, to crida’s sleep
bear cymri’s promise, which her king shall keep!”

cxxviii.
as thus he spoke, upon his outstretched arm
a light touch trembled,—turning he beheld
the maiden of the tomb; a wild alarm
stared from her eyes; his own their terror spelled.
struggling for speech, the pale lips writhed apart,
and, as she clung, he heard her beating heart;

cxxix.
while arthur marvelling soothed the agony
which, comprehending not, he still could share,
sudden sprang gawaine—hark! a timorous cry
pierced yon dim shadows!   arthur looked, and where,
on artful valves revolved the stony door,
a kneeling nun his knight is bending o’er.

cxxx.
ere the nun’s fears the knightly words dispel
as tow’rds the spot the maid and monarch came,
on arthur’s brow the slanted moon-beams fell,
and the nun knew the king, and called his name,
and clasped his knees, and sobbed thro’ joyous tears,
“once more! once more! our god his people hears!”

cxxxi.
kin to his blood—the welcome face of one
known as a saint throughout the christian land,
arthur recalled, and as a pious son
honouring a mother—on that sacred hand
in homage bowed the king, “what mercy saves
thee, blest survivor in this shrine of graves?”

cxxxii.
then the nun led them, thro’ the artful door
masked in the masonry, adown a stair
that coiled its windings to the grottoed floor
of vaulted chambers desolately fair;
wrought in the green hill, like an oread’s home,
for summer heats by some soft lord of rome.

cxxxiii.
on shells, which nymphs from silver sands might cull,
on paved mosaic, and long-silenced fount,
on marble waifs of the far beautiful
by graceful spoiler garnered from the mount
of vocal delphi, or the elean town,
or sparta’s rival of the violet-crown—

cxxxiv.
shone the rude cresset from the homely shrine
of that new power, upon whose syrian cross
perished the antique jove.   and the grave sign
of the glad faith (which, for the lovely loss
of poet-gods, their own olympus frees
to man,—men’s souls the new uranides—)

cxxxv.
high from the base, on which, of old, reposed
grape-crowned iacchus—spoke the saving woe!
within these crypts to prying daylight closed,
while o’er them, heaped by the fierce heathen foe,
their walls in smouldering ruin strewed the ground,
asylum safe the christian vestals found.

cxxxvi.
to peasants, scattered thro’ the neighbouring plains,
the secret known;—kind hands with pious care
supply such humble nurture as sustains
lives most with fast familiar; thus and there
the patient sisters in their faith sublime,
felt god was good, and waited for his time.

cxxxvii.
yet ever, when the crimes of earth and day
slept in the starry peace, to the lone tower
the sainted abbess won her nightly way,
and gazed on carduel!—’t was the wonted hour
when from the opening door the cymrian knight
saw the pale shadow steal along the light.

cxxxviii.
musing, the king the safe retreat surveyed,
and smoothed his brow from the time’s urgent care;
here—from the strife secure, might rest the maid
not meet the tasks which morn must bring, to share;
and pleased the mother’s pitying looks he eyed
bent on the young form creeping to her side.

cxxxix.
“king,” said the abbess, “from some distant clime
comes this fair stranger, that her eyes alone
answer our mountain tongue?”—“may happier time,”
replied the king, “her tale, her land, make known.
meanwhile, o kind recluse, receive the guest
to whom these altars seem the native rest.”

cxl.
the mother smiled, “in sooth those looks,” she said,
“do speak a soul pure with celestial air;
and in the morrow’s awful hour of dread,
her heart methinks will echo to our prayer,
and breathe responsive to the hymns that swell
the christian’s curse upon the infidel.

cxli.
“but say, if truth, from rumour vague and wild,
to this still world the friendly peasants bring,
‘that grief and wrath for some lost heathen child,
urge to yon walls the mercians’ direful king?’”—
“nay,” said the cymrian, “doth ambition fail—
when force needs falsehood, of the glozing tale?

cxlii.
“and—but behold the stranger faints, outworn
by the long wandering and the scorch of day!”
pale as a lily when the dewless morn,
parched in the fiery dog-star, wanes away
into the glare of noon without a cloud,
o’er the nun’s breast that flower of beauty bowed.

cxliii.
yet still the clasp retained the hand that prest,
and breath came still, tho’ heaved in sobbing sighs.
“leave her,” the mother said, “to needful rest,
and to such care as woman best supplies;
and may this charge a conqueror soon recall,
and change the refuge to a monarch’s hall!”

cxliv.
tho’ found the asylum sought, with boding mind
the crowning guerdon of his mystic toil
to the kind nun the unwilling king resigned;
nor till his step was on his mountain soil
did his large heart its lion calm regain,
and o’er his soul no thought by cymri reign.

cxlv.
as tow’rds the bark the friends resume their way,
quick they resolve the conflict’s hardy scheme;
with half the northmen, at the break of day
shall gawaine sail where sabra’s broadening stream
admits a reeded creek; and, landing there,
elude the fleet the neighbouring waters bear;

cxlvi.
thro’ secret paths with bush and bosk o’ergrown
wind round the tented hill, and win the wall;
with arthur’s name arouse the leaguered town,
give its pent stream the cataract’s rushing fall,
and launch, where crida hath encamped his horde,
all who in carduel yet survive the sword.

cxlvii.
meanwhile on foot the king shall guide his band
round to the rearward of the vast array,
where yet large fragments of the forest stand
to shroud with darkness the avenger’s way;—
thence, when least looked for, burst upon the foe,
on war’s own heart direct the sudden blow;

cxlviii.
thus, front and rear assailed, their numbers, less
(perplexed, distraught,) avail the heathen’s power.
dire were the odds: the chances of success
lay in the accurate seizure of the hour;
the high-souled rashness of the bold emprize;
the fear that smites the fiercest in surprize;

cxlix.
whatever worth the enchanted boons may bear;
the hero heart by which those boons were won;
the stubborn strength of that supreme despair,
when victory lost is a whole realm undone;
in the man’s cause, and in the christian zeal;
and the just god who sanctions freedom’s steel.

cl.
meanwhile, along a cavelike corridor
the stranger guest the gentle abbess led;
where the voluptuous hypocaust of yore
left cells for vestal dreams saint-hallowëd.
her own, austerely rude, affords the rest
to which her parting kiss consigns the guest.

cli.
but welcome not for rest that loneliness!
the iron lamp the imaged cross displays,
and to that guide for souls, what mute distress
lifts the imploring passion of its gaze?
fear like remorse—and sorrow dark as sin?
enter that mystic heart and look within!

clii.
what broken gleams of memory come and go
along the dark!—a silent starry love
lighting young fancy’s virgin waves below,
but shed from thoughts that rest ensphered above!
oh, flowers whose bloom had perfumed carmel, weave
wreaths for such love as lived in genevieve!

cliii.
a may noon resteth on the forest hill;
a may noon resteth over ruins hoar;
a maiden muses on the forest hill,
a tomb’s vast pile o’ershades the ruins hoar,
with doors now open to each prying blast,
where once to rot imperial dust had past;

cliv.
glides thro’ that tomb of eld the musing maid,
and slumber drags her down its airy deep.
o wondrous trance! in druid robes arrayed,
what form benignant charms the life-like sleep?
what spells low-chaunted, holy-sweet, like prayer,
plume the light soul, and waft it through the air?

clv.
comes a dim sense as of an angel’s being,
bathed in ambrosial dew and liquid day;
of floating wings, like heavenward instincts, freeing
thro’ azure solitudes a spirit’s way,—
an absence of all earthly thought, desire,
aim—hope,—save those which love and which aspire;

clvi.
each harder sense of the mere human mind
merged into some protective prescience;
calm gladness, conscious of a charge consigned
to the pure ward of guardian innocence;
and the felt presence, in that charge, of one
whose smile to life is as to flowers the sun.

clvii.
go on, thou troubled memory, wander on!
dull, o’er the bounds of the departing trance,
droops the lithe wing the airier life hath known;
yet on the confines of the dream, the glance
sees—where before he stood, the enchanter stand,
bend the vast brow, and stretch the shadowy hand.

clviii.
and, human sense reviving, on the ear
fall words ambiguous, now with happy hours
and plighted love,—and now with threats austere
of demon dangers—of malignant powers
whose force might yet the counter charm unbind,
if loosed the silence to her lips enjoined.—

clix.
then, as that image faded from the verge
of life’s renewed horizon—came the day;
yet, ere the vision’s last faint gleams submerge
into earth’s common light, their parting ray
on arthur’s brow the faithful memories leave,
and the dove’s heart still beats in genevieve!

clx.
still she the presence feels,—resumes the guide,
till slowly, slowly waned the prescient power
which gave the guardian to the pilgrim’s side;—
and only rested, with her human dower
of gifts sublime to soothe, but weak to save,
and blind to warn,—the daughter of the grave.

clxi.
yet the lost dream bequeathed, for evermore,
thoughts that did, like a second nature, make
life to that life the dove had hovered o’er
cling as an instinct,—and for that dear sake
danger and death had found the woman’s love
in realms as near the angels as the dove.

clxii.
and now and now is she herself the one
to launch the bolt on that belovëd life?
shuddering she starts, again she hears the nun
denounce the curse that arms the awful strife;
again her lips the wild cry stifle,—“see
crida’s lost child, thy country’s curse, in me!”

clxiii.
or—if along the world of that despair
fleet other spectres,—from the ruined steep
points the dread arm, and hisses thro’ the air
the avenger’s sentence on her father’s sleep!
the dead seem rising from the yawning floor,
and the shrine steams as with a shamble’s gore.

clxiv.
sudden she springs, and, from her veiling hands,
lifts the pale courage of her calmëd brow;
with upward eyes, and mumuring lips, she stands,
raising to heaven the new-born hope:—and now
glides from the cell along the galleried caves,
mute as a moonbeam flitting over waves,

clxv.
now gained the central grot; now won the stair;
the lamp she bore gleamed on the door of stone;
why halt? what hand detains?—she turned, and there,
on the nun’s serge and brow rebuking, shone
the tremulous light; then fear her lips unchained
from that stern silence by the dream ordained;

clxvi.
and at those holy feet the saxon fell
sobbing, “o stay me not! o rather free
these steps that fly to save his carduel!
throne, altars, life—his life!   in me, in me,
to these strange shrines, thy saints in mercy bring
crida’s lost child!—way, way to save thy king!”

clxvii.
listened the nun; doubt, joy, and awed amaze
fused in that lambent atmosphere of soul,
faith in the wise all-good!—so melt the rays
of varying iris in the lucid whole
of light;—“thy people still to thee are dear,
o lord,” she murmured, “and thy hand is here!”

clxviii.
“yes,” cried the suppliant, “if my loss deplored,
my fate unguest—misled and armed my sire;
when to his heart his child shall be restored,
sure, war itself will in the cause expire!
ruth come with joy,—and in that happy hour
hate drop the steel, and love alone have power?”

clxix.
then the nun took the saxon to her breast,
round the bowed neck she hung her sainted cross,
and said, “go forth—o beautiful and blest!
and if my king rebuke me for thy loss,
be my reply the gain that loss bestowed,—
hearths for his people, altars for his god!”

clxx.
she ceased;—on secret valves revolved the door;
breathed on the silent hill the dawning air;
one moment paused the steps of hope and o’er
the war’s vast slumber looked the soul of prayer.
so halts the bird that from the cage hath flown—
a light bough rustled, and the dove was gone."

there whispered murmurs of a bloody mutiny
we took up arms and slayed the officers of rank
and with swords drawn, made the captain walk the plank

an evil shadow followed us on every quest
never to feel joy again was our fate
only misery and death, fear and burning hate

yet, the curse still lives on
and now we rot in a black prison cell
waiting for our true calling in hell

i refract the reflecting surface of this unfathomable sea
growing circles of grief and pain slides across the land
as an omen of the horror yet to come

the strength of a thousand fire-breathing demons
breed in my infernal, sinking soul
and as i reach the surface once again
these powers are under my control
now i am one with the nightsky majesty"

The Sound Of Truth|As I Lay Dying|metal|"
we have all heard, what we wanted to hear
""truth"" that sounds right to our ears


but what wisdom, is there within us
to live based on, the feeling of our hearts?
how many times, has instinct let us down?
never to be, thought through, never to be questioned!
say what you really mean
when your ambition, calls you, calls you!
for what, use is there, is there in praying
if you will only hear what you want to hear?


we have all heard, what we wanted to hear
""truth"" that sounds right to our ears


we speak of fighting, to resist this world
but what about, the battle within us?
if we have chosen, to live against the grain
then why are we, all facing the same way?


there is no difference between us and them
if we all blindly, seek truth from sentiments

hatred burning, love extinct

useless human excrement, you deserve a life of shit

soul i condemn, fucking dead
nothing will ever be made right again
the path of damnation, i hasten you on my way

every day you lived from then is one more day you owe me
if killing you destroys myself, i wouldn't have it any other way
fine line between honor and horror, my every action justified
innocence destroyed, needs anguish to cleanse impurity

temporary insanity, obeys a singular purpose
your death row is here and now, the only righteous ending

on the high northern seas
we have found our way
the shadowing voices of our gods
singing on the calling winds...
where the cold waves and the longboats brought us far
the saga of the warriors from northland
speaks of greatness and strength
the saga of the warriors from northland
are the saga of many great a man

on seas against the open
we travelled on and on
through the raging winds
and storms we arrived
the shadowing voices of our gods
singing on the calling wind...
where the cold waves and the longboats brought us far
with sword in hand i now stand
on my enemies land
with a northern heart
i will fight until the day i die

my time will be remembered my time it will be known
by my sons by my tribe and by the sun the sea and moon

for the who battle for his land his pride and for his men
shall be remembered and stand eternally named
in the legends of our land

breathing in winds...
from the essence of a roaring horizon
breathing in winds...
from the cold sea call the shores of the north"
To Hell and Back|Sabaton|metal|"a short man from texas
a man of the wild
thrown into combat
where bodies lie piled
hides his emotions
his blood is running cold
just like his victories
his story unfolds

bright, a white light
if there'd be
any glory in war
let it rest
on men like him

dead men will never come back


crosses grow on anzio
where no soldiers sleep
and where hell is six feet deep
that death does wait
there's no debate
so charge and attack
going to hell and back

a man of the 15th
a man of can do
friends fall around him
and yet he came through
let them fall face down
if they must die
making it easier
to say goodbye

bright, a white light
if there'd be
any glory in war
let it rest
on men like him

who went to hell and came back


crosses grow on anzio
where no soldiers sleep
and where hell is six feet deep
that death does wait
there's no debate
so charge and attack
going to hell and back

oh gather 'round me
and listen while i speak
of a war where hell is six feet deep
and all along the shore
where cannons still roar
they're haunting my dreams
they're still there when i sleep




he saw crosses grow on anzio
where no soldiers sleep
and where hell is six feet deep
that death does wait
there's no debate
he charged and attack
he went to hell and back"
Wind Of Change|Scorpions|metal|"
i follow the moskva
down to gorky park
listening to the wind of change
an august summer night
soldiers passing by
listening to the wind of change


the world is closing in
and did you ever think
that we could be so close, like brothers?
the future's in the air
i can feel it everywhere
blowing with the wind of change


take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change


walking down the street
and distant memories
are buried in the past forever
i follow the moskva
and down to gorky park
listening to the wind of change


take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
with you and me
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change


the wind of change blows straight
into the face of time
like a storm wind that will ring
the freedom bell for peace of mind
let your balalaika sing
what my guitar wants to sing




take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
with you and me
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change"
The Siren's Song|Parkway Drive|metal|"virtue is lost

beyond this sleek veneer
beneath the neon existence
her face is grey
and everything she longs for turns to black
the chemicals bring little vindication
and white lines lace every vein
does she realise what she's become?

but she's not waking
and she's still failing
but she's not waking
she's still failing

follow the siren's song
to face this empty cycle
searching the darkest nights
searching the silence

and does it make you sick?
""can you hear me, is she conscious?""
does it make you feel beautiful?
bloodshed under the streetlight

and does it make you sick?
""oh god! we've got a bleeder here.""
does it make you beautiful?
heartbreak under the streetlight

she's lost again
adrenalin strains corrupted arteries

virtue is lost

beyond this sleek veneer
beneath the neon existence
her face is grey
and everything she longs for is pulling away

searching the darkest night
searching the silence

strip back the utopian rhetoric

a septic carcass rotting out
filled with disgust

empty lives, empty heads
guilty is as guilty fucking does
filled with disgust


all we have to believe are the lies that they feed us
all we have to choose is the right to obey
pray this time, we'll be our mark on history

deconstructed and paralyzed so slowly
somehow i am evaporating
we dream to be the lesser
a malign separate existence
we belittle ourselves to a lesser
being our dreams are not our dreams

cogitation a distant fragment
separate me from the whole
my thoughts are now unchained

and it seems that in everything we want
isn't anything we need
and all the signals we seem to have taken for granted
we are lost, we are polluted
into the grey, a wolf amongst ravens

lines flicker and twist descending
a distorted creation from nothing
so monstrous, so murderous

you crystallize the world around you
you aim for the weak
a twisting sleep breaks inside of me

a sickness
you live in
i begin to break away
please set me free

i will remain amongst the filth
conceal my self in this residuum
i will remain amongst the filth

Building A Man|Gorgoroth|metal|"(1:13)

restorator (host): yo, introduce yourself, please
oxxxy: oxxxymiron
r: who's your enemy today?
o: a man who asserted himself by philip kirkorov's miserable 'davai, do svidaniya'. the man who rules the black star broadcast called 'radio'. in a nutshell, he does everything that i wouldn't wish even an enemy to do
r: how come you guys are battling today?
o: he asked me to battle him so i've come
r: wow, how it's all that simple
o: well, he has two significant wins on versus. so, it'd rather ask why some 'homebodys' keep asking me for a battle despite they haven't battled at all. as an mc who has been here, i can say that it's really different feeling when you are staying here. that's it
r: ok, it's cool. i'm just nervous like those people who are sitting in front of their screens right now. they be like 'finally, it's dropped!'
o: especially bookmakers!
r: yeah, some say this is all your doing *trolling*
o: it's all my doing! *also trolling*
r: good luck!
o: ok, thanks


r: yo, introduce yourself, please
st: hello everybody, my name is st
r: who's your enemy today?
st: oxxxymiron
r: what can you say about him?
st: everything i can say you'll hear soon
r: why did you ask him to battle you?
st: because it's gonna be an interesting battle and i think that it's necessary to battle strong enemies
r: who else would you battle? who's also a strong one?
st: now i've chosen only oxxxy
r: great! i think the battle's gonna be extremely dope. really extremely! good luck. bear up, boys, bear up!
st: thank you

battle!
r: hi everyone, it's your boy restorator and it's versus battle. make some fucking noise! let me introduce the judges that will choose the winner of this battle. let them justify themselves
dmitriy egorov aka gabonskaya goduka, make some noise. andrey nikitin, the-flow.ru, afisha. dj sto vos'moi. battler to my left, introduce yourself

st: st, moscow
r: battler to my right!
o: oxxxymiron
r: according to the results of the coin task, the first round's on oxxxymiron. make some fucking noise!


(3:40)
shitty question!
i'm also an extremely cool poet
i can also write poetry and give it for rap
check this out:
(3:53)
we're staying infront of the oil painting
i wish i could cause repin's pride by it
there is the rapper's generalized character
printed with black, white and red print
look how correctly contours are emphasized
right to a tee
baggy, antediluvian, subcultural attributes
but some things are missing such as
basketball, onyx cap, a bottle with a hole, fighting dogs and a paint tank
seems like he was conceived in a test-tube - the rapper's generalized character
he's kinda a specimen number 95
- a bit stupid and ridiculous but in fact our brother
he looks alive, like from decl's movie
looks like he's gonna rap right know
just right now, that flow, like his black brothers, come on!

(4:36)

you are a bad sambist - used to using foul language
your rap has no balls - like castrate's poetry
your rap has no balls - you are nothing in the game
your rap has no balls - you ain't a poet, you are a poetess

(4:52)

whaaaaaaaat?
you've taken hip hop's wrapper
i mean you've got clothes, manners and gestures
but you're still worthless
you wigger look like black but you rap like you're white
i look like white but i rap like i'm black
and you know it, and everybody knows it - it's a fact
your caps and t-shirts don't make you be like 2pac

(5:15)
no, it's cargo cult, your rap is a carnival
your flow is corvalolum, my flow is manowar
i'm a rapper, you are a joker, in this battle you're a padawan
give me rap, not pun. give me verses, not tomfoolery

(5:26)
'tick tick boom' rap isn't fooly, rap is napalm
it's gonna be the knockout of century, taste the itensity of the storm
while the game nervously smokes standing on the head
my verse will fuck your success
what are you doing here?
it's not your world, you aren't a battle-rapper
you are a fucking deceased
any nickname can be easily changed on yours
and yours on anyone else's
only fan will destinguish the difference in the tracks

(5:50)
because you are gray, an abolutely gray mc
you've got self-confidence, but you don't have manners and style
i'll rape you exploring your career in details
after that i'll disinfect my dick, give me miramistin
i've got hundreeds mc's flows, you are a goldfinch
i can easily be an executioner or a humorist
i'm so far from you in everything connected with rap
there is nothing more asymmetrical in this world than this battle
(6:10)
but you asked me for battle, i didn't ask
i wouldn't have asked you even if it had been a spiritism session
it's not punches and skills agaisnt the important sense
battles mean life for me, for you - it's only business
coz you sell tickets on your concerts after your battles because of the hype
don't act like you don't coz it's true
(6:30)
i hadn't been battling for a year and i had 25 thousand concert
you'll never do the same
i don't need this versus - only you need
because your music doesn't attract any listeners
what will you lose if you don't win? come on, st?
what are you risking today, bro, tell me asap
you're risking nothing
he's battling agaisnt favorite, his rap is much different
he's just singing and talking
it's enough for him to jump over his head at once
and he gets 100 points - we've got the new king of the hill!
but if i overeach oneself or branch off at once
to make me be thrown on the shroud of christ
it's gladness for people, coz you are powereless and weak as they are
forgive me this pathos, but here it's exactly what i said

(7:09)
but you know what, st? fuck you!
fuck you, because if you were clever
you would come hear like gucci mane
yeah, fuck you! i'm ugk!
but when your rap's listening to mine, it does 'twerk-twerk - booty shake'
fuck you, i didn't want to battle
but i need to calm those who would like to hinder me
your trash talk in the instagram, your shameless 'go on, hello bitch'
for you i'm not oxxxmiron, i'm miron yanovich
(7:40)
and i was told 'hey, just think, who you are battling with
just adjust, don't make it hard, do it accessibly'
but i'm trying not to body my enemy
i'm trying to body my achievements from previous battle
i'm watching world's best leagues, we are legging behind
the way i'm trying to make it is to show the rise in russia
(7:54)
i'm not complicating the lyrics, man, you're just shell-shocked
i'm not rapping fast, you're just listening slow
get used to it, hip-hop has never been a culture for fools
but after some people like st fucked it up
if only people knew english
if they could google in it
people like you would never show off here

(8:08)
bro, i'm cracking up, it's very emotional
beaver, exhale! beaver, exhale!
you're a full-grown bull
it's something new for me
i battled: dwarfs, junkies i said 'goodbye' to an actor
but believe, when i'll bend you in a lyrical ram's horn
i won't give a fuck about your physical state
3 rounds: light, camera, action
no respect, no understanding - i'm not harry topor
you expected to come here as a smiling games-master
and me to give you that what i've been bulding year by year
that because of what i didn't sleep and went through a bullshit
just give it to you? bro, you conceited
just tell me, how many years you've been making your verse
(8:49)
despite the time, it is quite medium
without any 'bla bla bla', it's constrained and faded
but i'd prefer freshblood and co instead of crowned mc
why do i need to be in the main versus if there is only hovan and he

(9:10)
you are a combination of everything i'm ashamed in rap
from fucker's clothes to down's lexicon
your terrible tries to make memes from your songs
ooooh, it's a topic for the second round. versus!

r: st round 1, make some noise


ok, a writer and an mc
on versus, where the doings will meet us
like a young maiden during the critical days
who's unable to keep the bloodshed

(9:54)
we see each other for the first time
but we've already had to hate each other and start insulting
to please the gathered here crowd

(10:04)
i know why you are angry as a dog
you was conceived by a cancer
and it seems like that stars converged when you were born
so the whole life you've been let down like a commode in the women's wc

(10:15)
as a child you used to have a mushroom shape haircut
you used to be so household that you peed in a cat tray
you are your father's puppy
not in the sense that you're his bitch
but in the sense that you used to wait for your parents at home like hachiko
(10:27)
you wanted to have a brother? but he didn't want to have you
you were so dumb that you came to a blackboard and ate chalk
you weren't liked by girls so you considered all women as bitches
the chalk wasn't your limit so you started to study hard
and you were good at it, i have to admit he did well
i imagine how you were sitting at home swotting and drinking tea with your father
but after urgant there is the only one punch is clear:
'on versus only sin used to love drinking tea more than you used to'

(10:56)
it's painful for miron to remember his school days
it was terrible time
despite he started to bait his first jokes by that time
people shouted to him 'miron is faggot' in a minibus
'miron's faggot...', excuse me, angry children shouted it to him
he cried clanching his fists and wasn't able to answer them
he ran home where he had loads of his idols posters
to forget how toilets were washed by his head
you declaimed all that bawdry and filthy language
all that violent laguage that was adressed to you
(11:25)
you knew that the revenge would be cruel with time
you soaked up like a sponge all these knowledges with a suffering taste
in any bunch you were a lousy sheep
people said 'fuck you' more than they sent you for beer

(11:39)
but you were a lucky one
your parents understood that if you keep grewing here you'll become blunt
because you were so different person
that when someone said 'yo dawg, got something to read?' you would bring goethe's tom

(11:56)

definetly!


and god forbid that something happens in yards with the son
you were taken abroad away from possible troubles
and at the same moment he became dangerous, it flashed upon him
the time came to let the world know how angry you was

(12:13)
after all, the world became tolerant
after cutting down the jungles on the neigbourhood
people simply show their iphones 6 at nights
you can be nothing in the real life, but be cool in a studio
and we won't forget that gangstas aren't the same as the used to be

(12:34)
who saw a book called 'our people'?
author of which is scut
there oxxxy is the real hip-hop...of two old single women
it's every male's personal choice with who he's in relationships
but miron, it's not respectful to live with your mother when you are 30
it's known as 2 times 2: our complexes, problems - it's all comes from the childhood
and because at school miron yanovich didn't get the customs
he started whining to show off

(13:07)
when he was suggested playing in a yard
he refused it
sewing courses and children's choir he declined both times
but his first nervous breakdown happened in an assembly hall
'during the third quarter i refused more offers than you've ever had'

(13:27)
and despite today he's got a lot of offers
i still feel that childhood trauma's trace
i wish somebody would evoked a kristina si's track
are we calling? are you ready to hear the refuse?

(13:39)
by the way, the duet would be really nice
i already see the teaser
kristina si and oxxxy, such a group called 'sisi'
i'm independent artist - st 100 of 100
bitch, i was writing texts for your ghostwriters
and i'll rewrite here a proverb for y'all right now
'i've won 2 battles but the god loves 3'

(14:03)
do you see? there is a friend of mine


good luck!


but i guess you all have got a simple question
why would i give a fuck about him if he is an asshole?
and if i'm a right boy and also very famous
why do i have 100...200 people in my concerets?
and why am i near a bar instead of a stage in a club?
it's stupid to hide. oh yeah, i'm hear for pr
i sell my rap, but no one will say that i sell myself
and, anyway, everyone in this building knows my bars
from 'rap can't be stamped, it's art'
'but on the edge, while going to the bottom, i'm not drinking, i'm celebrating'

(14:55)
but there is jealousy, anger, offense at myself inside of me
for loads of chances that were given to me but weren't implemented by me
and all the talks and gossips are mostly about my past
i became meticulously right, extremely good
and your success is a mistake, but primarily our
that we relaxed when we had to hard work

(15:21)
i have the things i can be proud of
but i'm only learning how to be proud of them
i'm proud of my songs that are sung by heart at concerts
i'm proud of you, my listener, who were back to back with me
during this winding road in lockstep

(15:35)
my way is different lables
and don't know if it's good or bad
but things went bad there when i left
there is coincidence or god's gift
those who notice that write to me 'sanya, it's time to go to blackstar'

(15:53)
and here today i have to be honest with you, friends
i subscribed to blackstar, but only in instagram
but when we all are done laughing
it's time to wipe the smile
and correct made earlier mistake
miron in a battle is like a fish in water
that's belly up but isn't drowned
you didn't turn the game. it's the game turned you

(16:26)
and if you wanna know where your place in hip-hop is
you can pour milk in cereals for me in morning
i'm rap, king ring, phlatline, davai do svidaniya
i'm here for lynching your megalomania

(16:40)
my irony of fate, your city under the sole
you only need to know what i left in the past
i'm rapinfo, i've been going ahead when you were peeing in a table
i'm bzr, i'm beats and vibes
you are rap and broll, here you're rap and broll

(16:53)
i'm independent and loved
for the beauty, audacity
i'm underground, i'm mainstream, i'm kytyza. versus!

r: oxxxymiron, 2nd round, come on!


(17:14)
ok, there are some characters
an angry nerd, as u said, and a kind alpha male
and in this regard, it's a unique opposition
but there is reality
where you are a dwarf who climbed the alps
and who really wants to be a giant
well, you can be a giant if you want
but, firstly, let's recall our creative development
it's the answer to your previous verse

(17:44)
sanya grow up in the centre of moscow with loads of fellas
i had been roaming in europe as a fucking weed since i was 9
life taught me, as it teaches mongreles
i didn't know the language, i was always a stranger
but sanya was a lucky one
he was growing up on kutuzov avenue, he was in his element
he's got good height and he is favored
i had been lugging a fucking backpack alone after school for 7 years in a row
at least i've learned a hard lesson - to rely only on myself
to never tickle fancy if that people first had despised you
not to follow a fucking crowd, to be in no haste to be 2nd, 3rd, 5th just to belong
not to try to be a part of the game

(18:26)
sanya's also learned a lesson
that he will always be favored and no need to find unique ways
just to go with the current, to be friends with everybody
to do everything that people desire - rap for a soul
trap for cars, today is today, tomorrow's another day

(18:38)
i've been rising not just from the bottom
i started much below zero
2008, do y'all remember my trac was playing on mp3 players?


'this is zero zero eight, remember this memorable date
we're wrecking you, like candy-floss in a circus
russian rap would bend without me as dali's mustache
i'll mary your mother to adopt you!'


that's when people know the lyrics

(19:00)
it's the first song. 8 years ago it was strict taboo
everyone was wearing pipes, everyone was trying to resemble wu
by that moment, i hadn't been living in russia for 15 years
just tell me, did i have a chance to get rid of regime in russian rap?
but i've got rid of, haven't i? then what have you got rid of?
you've only got rid of weight when you were running from the police
because you've smoked and rapped with every famous mc
as you said, and it doesn't matter with who - with centre or timati - rus elite

(19:24)
the first who found you was serega, 'black bmw', king ring
he signed you on the label, thinking it would be a dream team
but ...




continue, it's ok, you are doing well!


the rest will also come out?:d


(20:00)
the first who found you was serega, 'black bmw', king ring
he signed you on the label, thinking it would be a dream team
but you got pr and went to phlatline, it was so long ago
but he can admit, know it

(20:16)
you're a defector, you wanted to be a friend of everyone's so much
that you left conflict labe to be friends with everybody
but, wait a minute, you also left phlatline
and joined invisible management but then left it and joined black star's show
your ridge is jelly
st is broken highlighter because you've got no stem
dude, you ain't constant like a puddle in sand
coz if you are friends with everybody, you are a friend of no one's
and you don't do trap, you just follow trends
you are cathing memes, hashtags and brands
man, you are always spoiling the beats with your rap
moscow has already got a burr talent and it's not you

(21:03)
and it's not you, then who are you?
you are a trimmer, opportunistic
you are in russian rap only as a host
you are a toast-master, any caprice for price
your whole career is endless 'beats and vibes'

(21:17)
it's unfair doom, why did you ask me to battle here?
you are a host, you have to battle restorator! true story!
if you are that cool and confident boy, tell me
why your career is nothing? no, i know that you aren't dunya
but was it your dream to gather in small clubs?
considering how you tried to trickle fancy and to comply with market conditions
your honorariums are nothing
but, you know, no one believed in me earlier
i mean no one! literally, like in pihto grandfather
but i stemmed the tide, straright to a whirlpool
i was oversteered, i did by way of contrast
for the long 8 years without the reference point
i withdrawed from a team only once - you all know the incentive

(21:58)
i've been going ahead for years and here is my turn
people used to say 'i won't work', know they say 'it'll pass soon'
but fuck it, stop cathing, try to do it yourself
i motivate you, where are your balls, sanya?
where are you alpha? you're a companion, a picayune copmanion
i'm not right, you aren't a host. the host is i, you are driven

(22:17)
there are some characters:
an angry nerd and a kind alpha male
and there is reality
where you are a milksop in a herd of sheep choir
and i'm like a hobbit - frodo baggins from rings romance
i'll get what i want despite i'm not brave. versus!

oxxxymiron: serega shocked me

restorator: yeah, i'm also shoked. st round 2, let's go


i've just remember this...some chukovskij's lines
cockroach, cockroach, a small cockroach
a small weak insect
doesn't it hurt you all? aren't you all ashamed?
now round!

(23:21)
take your sits, and stock up the popcorn
again there is a burr guy, one of dorn's backing dancers
comfortable place your ass in front of your screen
there is a battle with macho and nerd's colloquial form

(23:32)
so, hello, yana
what's going on with your face? what a sad smile
your hanna montana has outgrown to miley cyrus
you've brawled and produced hundreds of memes in the internet
you had outgrown disney and then you wanted dicks

(23:46)
superfluous care and attention that's how he has been growing up
and abstaining, abstaining
during the rabbi cicrumcision he sneezed - this is shit
and after that you remember - measure thrice and cut once

(24:01)
you are a der ewige jude, i've heard something like that about you
are you kidding? you ain't a der eweige jude. der eweige jude is misha krypin
you called l'one a betrayer, while puffing something in the stage
you are idiot, l'one would kayo you with one elbow

(24:16)
you dedicated the whole round to a fact that i'm burr
but you gave it to hovan as a debt
and comedian to the right won
comedian, charles!
i was watching and i thought 'what a freak'
you struck out the jokes about gorgorod

(24:35)
do you understand that the world has a screw losse
any outlaw could battle with me here today
it doesn't matter if he writes himself or he's got a songwriter
anyone, even if in life he is the last outsider

(24:48)
i want to refer to your fans
i want to speak like sarah with a jew
if there is no difference between hovan and he
then why do we have to pay more?

(25:05)
especially you behave rudely with your fans
wait! stop! stop!
what if you don't write to urii and hovan writes to you?
then it explains why he is a judge
he's a dark horse here, secret weapon
the real power behind the versus' throne
who's working here for beer and food
well, if it's true, then i praise you - well done!

(25:37)
your battle against johnyboy - you don't have to be very clever
how many viewes are there? anybody knows?


21 million


21 million! well, johny made you a star
because of him you've become so famous battler in a get-together
so you can consider johnyboy your producer
even though oxxxy is a pussy master of in-battle discussions
but everybody knows how many times pussy oxxxy's played the woman out of battle
and even after that the bitch managed to be in the black
did you think you are keiser in the kitchen? maximum zanussi
so muschi, schweine with strange straße
you're like a veggie in a plain - ain't meat, ain't a fish

(26:13)
i'm not crowned with a crown despite my way is thorny
those who didn't believe in my success i call atheists
miron's become a big guy. did you turn all toys at home?
he's so big that his father let him make tattoo

(26:40)
he's got a label, the empire
and he's a mad empress there
in the arms of the young gentlemans he forgets everything

(26:52)
well, why am i saying 'father, father'
i mean my father has left my family
doesn't matter how i brag but there is still a precipitate
he is happy right now with a new wife and two kids
and i'm glad that he's ok
but i resemble him and sometimes i'm afraid of it
because i've got my own family lately
and if earlier all these punches went past
then now i've got heel of achilles, i become vulnerable
bulletproof. a bulletproof vest has been becoming dusty in my closet for 2 years
i get up in mornings and make a coffee for my wife, and most of mates aren't alive right now
they passed away too early
someone went to a bump, someone in a fight, someone by accordion
and i'm always young and drunk, with receding hairline growing to my top
i have to stay here with you, fop, and to compare?
when you all were abroad dissing russian rap
dissing everyone from the police to just random guests of the capital
skinheads, punks, bikers and rockers
you were about to break for wearing wide pants
while you were in germany sniffing dog's ass
your life was like a match - a brown stripe

(27:58)
once he transported black humor in his underpants
plus who'll understand. do you know how are african american called
that transport a coconut in the ass across the border? bounty!

(28:11)
so you are bounty on the contrary
your whole life is marketing ploy like your battle here agaisnt anyone
you've come to amuse the people and to receive an ovation
but i'm not a battle-rapper, and i'm not here for the prize
i haven't challenged you, i've challenged myself
i screw around that story
i've been living that life about which you've read in books
i'm an accident survivor boy, i'm from the streets of the capital
my friends' photos are the history of hip-hop in faces
your history isn't more than a slap in the face
but you were afraid to ask schokk for the battle
you are a coward, you don't have the battle inside of you
you are a dummy bullet, but i put everything at stake right now like always
it's not my city, it's not my bar, and i'll leave it on shield or with the shield

(29:03)
it would be better to say that my game
my game, my game
my game's on the enemy's side
i didn't say no names, but you've taken the challenge


to who?


you are so conceited that your a no-name for me

(29:18)
in my childhood i had mouses
you know like this, i had them
they were a boy and girl and they raised up seed
but the most mad things start next
firstly, the female  tormented the male despite he was a strong one
and, after that, she ate her children. so, miron, you are a mouse

(29:40)
you are afraid to attack and you open your mouth only in defense
is it your land, you locals? he is semi-petersburg
all your doubful regalias and trophies
when you're talking you are lev tolstoy, but in practice thinner

(29:55)
you are a carousel in which everyone's sitting but spanish shame
the carusel is so unwinded that everyone's sick of you
you are done with yourself, it doesn't even need a satire
an artist must be hungry but your is raging because of fat
i'll understand it now, and everyone'll get it
you came out of this, and i've brought you back
i let the star down to ground
i told you that i resemble my father? miron, fuck you!

restorator: 3rd round, oxxxymiron, let's go


if i'm a mouse then you are a peacock with feathers in the ass
the only reason i've accepted the challenge is drunk restorator said about that in periscope

(31:01)
do you all know what says everything about him?
his favourite book is 'the master and margarita'
it's from your interview, 'the master and margarita'
what do you think of the story line about the writers of massolit?
oh, you haven't reread for a long time?
oh, you bought it as a digest at avito
'the master and margarita', maybe the tale about aibolit?
i fucked an instagram babe with a nickname 'cool aphrodite!'
all her photos with the book 'the master and margarita'
mikhail bulgakov is crying 'you hoes, put the book down
the white guard, turbin's days
the dog's heart, the fatal eggs
zoyka's flat, you jerks'

(31:47)
and that connoisseur of syllable claims that he's a poet
a lot of topics i've seen and read. bro, no!
you are a very bad mc for sure, and not the biggest esthete


esthete, you know


(32:05)
no the biggest esthete, you are even the creator of shitty songs, anyone but not a poet
poetry for you is what was given to swot: pushkin, avet, tiutchev and fet
a lot of tortured kids that are learning a fucking sonnet
listen to me, the advice for you:
that's not it, it's boring, it's dead
need a poet - that's easy!
anyone: here is rimbaud, there is gumilev
cobain, villon, lautreamont
egor letov and block
alexey nikonov plus eric starks
pdr, krovostok, atl and loc-dog
they are poets, the power and light
they've got it, but you haven't
you're reading verses with expression
but everyone doesn't give a fuck coz you ain't a poet
the poet always has a conflict inside of him
the poet always aims to lie like a shadow of a doubt
some demons, some fucking super ideas
sometimes aspiration to lie under granite
chaos and pain, troubles with himself
fears of freedom, thanatos, love
people say that i'm hysterical, of course because i'm alive, yo
i'm a third-rate poet, but a premium mc
you are neigher fish, flesh nor fowl
you'd better inspire by backstreet boys and 'n sync
instead of gheto boys and jay z and know lemme ask you

(33:00)
what an inner conflict this man's got?
whether he choose trainers to match a snapback?

(33:16)
it's awkward for a poet to admit if he is
because he is shy and can't say 'boo' to a goose
and if he overcomes himself then he is an eternal showing off kid
poet is usually sick, his spirit is bare as a wire
you are a typical complacent glad asshole
why not? automobile, football, discotheque, beer, tv, wife
what a fucking poet you are. you're a typical medium type manager
he is a soul of a company, always has an office romance
your hobby has a namee, unfortunately you are a graphomaniac
unfortunately it's not curable, there are loads of graphomaniacs
'elderly storm newspapers', 'young people storm the internet'
no matter what they'll tell me
if i'm snob, if i'm on the high ropes
but please, god, save me from reading the poetry for retirees
poet's work is sacral, people see and you can't fool them
you are really charming, but amateur and charmer
you don't wanna be on the razor edge
where it's not plowed and sowed
why would you have to if you can just give them third-rate remix on yesenin
i've spent most of my life in a laboratory finding a spell
sanya, it's my territory, look how i do it
i mean:

(34:21)
no verses about it since last summer
the first who made thousands of euros battle-rapping
a responsibility on my shoulders like epaulettes
i'm alpha and omega, no matter what they saying
boy, i'm not happy to walk to canossa
the sky with a fresh pus colour, courtyards, wells
pots, to wake up as a girl with a teenager's hairstyle
just give me beat and i'll built my own space
i'm hanging under any lousy for long time
an hour has rooted in an intersection as an upstream pillar
i'm battling to not let activity of the brain down
my flow is a ddos attack we've got the remote control
rap for those who see lies and deceit
for those who isn't inspired by korzh and l'one
who knows everything and that's why it's sick to look at the screen
even if 'city under the sole' was always there

(35:03)
st, it seems like you are better than i
as a husband, as a son and as a citizen maybe you are better than i
and you cook borscht much better than i do
but your rap is fucking trash
listen to me, they'll say i've got no soul
i don't see the god's light, but you ain't an mc
ain't a man, ain't a poet, who are you?
medusa turns to a rock when she is looking in the mirror

The Great Hendowski|Of Mice & Men|metal|"i met a guy with some coins in his can
his face was weathered, dark and sad
he looked up to me and asked something i'll never forget
he said, ""how can you smile with your lips
wrapped around a loaded gun? how can you smile?
look at this life, is this all we've got?""

and my reply was quick
read this book, you were meant to live
it all means so much to me
but note what's written in red, it says...
it speaks of hope, trust and love
the fear of never being good enough
we were all made the same, i know it's tough
please don't give up!

don't speak that way
cause i won't allow you

you're too young to live this way
just close your eyes and see the true meaning
you're too young to live this way
just look around and see that life is beauty

how can you smile when this life is all we've got?
there's no hole inside, no time that's long enough
that can be saved or healed, there's nothing that
can't be covered with love!

don't speak that way
cause i won't allow you

you're too young to live this way
just close your eyes and see the true meaning
you're too young to live this way

there's hope, there's love, i know there is a void
there's hope and there is love

22 Faces|Periphery|metal|"
staring at the hourglass, my life, it feels like a machine
running with no direction
watching time as it draws a perception obscene
from a resurrection
choking on reality, the walls of my insides, they bleed
from the excess incisions
drawn and quartered by the monster who pulls on the strings
from the core of me


whoa, yeah i'm dying to see
what it is that is eating away at me
now the stars are deciding my world
they burn from the inside out


ice cold in the flames burning all around
so blind to the beauty of sleep

tearing a hole inside

thrashing, hoping for a better way
the push, the pull
it's tearing apart my will to thrive in the day
pins and needles jabbing into my veins
on the verge of losing sanity
the beast tears and i can't do a thing about it


whoa, yeah i'm dying to see
what it is that is eating away at me

Her Ghost In The Fog|Cradle Of Filth|metal|"the moon, she hangs like a cruel portrait
soft winds whisper the bidding of trees
as this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
and the mid-nightmare trampling of dreams

but oh, no tears please
fear and pain may accompany death
but it is desire that shepherds its certainty
as we shall see

she was divinity's creature that kissed in cold mirrors
a queen of snow, far beyond compare
lips attuned to symmetry sought her everywhere
dark liquored eyes, an arabian nightmare

she shone on watercolors of my pond life as pearl
until those who couldn't have her, cut her free of this world

that fateful eve when the breeze stank of sunset and camphor
their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
an inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast
on my love picking rue by the light of the moon

putting reason to flight or to death is their way
they crept through woods mesmerized
by the taffeta ley of her hips that held sway
over all they surveyed save a mist on the rise
a deadly blessing to hide her ghost in the fog
they raped and left, five men of god, her ghost in the fog

dawn discovered her there beneath the cedar's stare
silk dress torn, her raven hair flown to gown her beauty bared
was starred with frost, i knew her lost
i wept 'til tears crept back to prayer

she'd sworn me vows in fragrant blood
""never to part, lest jealous heaven stole our hearts""
then this i screamed ,""come back to me
for i was born in love with thee
so why should fate stand in between?""

and as i drowned her gentle curves
with dreams unsaid and final words
i espied a gleam trodden to earth
the church bell tower key

the village mourned her by the by
for she'd been a witch, their men had longed to try
and i broke under christ seeking guilty signs
my tortured soul on ice

a queen of snow
far beyond compare
lips attuned to symmetry
sought her everywhere
trappistine eyes
an arabian nightmare

she was erzulie possessed
of a milky white skin
my porcelain yin
a graceful angel of sin

and so for her
the breeze stank of sunset and camphor
my lantern chased her phantom and blew
their chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain
best reserved for judgement that their bible construed

putting reason to flight
or to flame unashamed
i swept from cries
mesmerized
by the taffeta ley
or her hips that held sway
over all those at bay
save a mist on the rise
a final blessing to hide
her ghost in the fog

and i embraced
where lovers rot
her ghost in the fog

her ghost in the fog"
The Enemy Inside|Dream Theater|metal|"

i'm bearing the burden within
open wounds hidden under my skin

looking for the life i left behind
these suffocating memories
are etched upon my mind
and i can't escape from the enemy inside


i sever myself from the world
and shut down completely
all alone in my own living hell
overcome with irrational fear

under the weight of the world on my chest
i buckle and break as i try to catch my breath
tell me i'm not dying


i'm running from the enemy inside
looking for the life i left behind
these suffocating memories
are etched upon my mind
and i can't escape from the enemy inside


i'm a burden, i'm a travesty
i'm a prisoner of regret
between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
i am hanging on the edge

disaster lurks around the bend
paradise came to an end
and no magic pill
can bring it back again

you find it hard to look again

on dancing shadows from behind

Follow The Signs|Born Of Osiris|metal|"follow the signs

we are the victims but we are also the crime
and the only one who can judge us is the earth in time

beyond what you perceive
as you're tangled in thought, believe
and let your soul unleash
we're well on our way but they lead us astray
perpetuate with distractions
as fare as we've made only as one we can save humanity

the absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded
heartache will stem from fear

ultimately the choice is up to you (the choice is up to you)
but in the end disbelief can't be denied can not be refused

they tremble in fear in the undercover sanctuary
and the walls disguise despair in the undercover sanctuary

i will show you more, we're uncovering
let your soul unleash

the absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded

and the only one who can judge us is the earth in time

we are victims yet we are the crime

Sculptor Of Flesh|1349|metal|"do you hear them calling from beyong?

as a foulness ye shall know them
as a foulness thou knowest thyself

freed from the shackles of morality
and long long gone is the need for science
through the wakening of the beast within

when you felt the power... the power in your mind
no longer confined to nocturnal solitude

walk among the herd
mold them as you wish
in images of unearthly bizarrerie

do you hear them calling from beyong?

sculptor of flesh
architect of abomination
mold the living flesh like clay

sculptor of flesh
warp the world
to your linking

and no new day will rise on humanity

will you grieve for them?

will the lack of their bleating cacophony
strike a note within?

rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding

violence is now a way of life
the sledge's my tool to torture
as it pounds down on your forehead

eyes bulging from their sockets
with every swing of my mallet
i smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
through the cracks, blood does leak
distorted beauty, catastrophe
steaming slop, splattered all over me

lifeless body, slouching dead
lecherous abscess, where you once had a head

avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
you will never live again, soon your life will end
i'll see you die at my feet, eternally i smash your face
facial bones collapse as i crack your skull in half

crushing, cranial, contents

draining the snot, i rip out the eyes
squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
involuntarily pulpifying facial regions

suffer, and then you die
torture, pulverized

at one with my sixth sense, i feel free
to kill as i please, no one can stop me

created to kill, the carnage continues
violently reshaping human facial tissue

brutality becomes my appetite

Into The Infinity Of Thoughts|Emperor|metal|"as the darkness creeps over the northern mountains of norway
and the silence reach the woods, i awake and rise...
into the night i wander, like many nights before
and like in my dreams, but centuries ago

under the moon, under the trees

beyond the light of a new day
into the frozen nature chilly
beyond the warmth of the dying sun
hear the whispering of the wind
the shadows calling...

i gaze into the moon which grants me visions
these twelve full moon nights of the year
and for each night the light of the holy disciples fades away

weaker and weaker, one by one
weaker and weaker, one by one

i gaze into the moon which makes my mind pure as crystal lakes
my eyes cold as the darkest winter nights, by yet there is a flame inside

so i slip below
i can't resist the undertow
so i slip below
i can't resist the undertow

i find no solace
beneath a godless sky
will i find shelter
in the places the sun could never find?

because everything's turning black
and i see no hope of turning back

cold terror grips my lungs
to let it in would be to accept defeat
but what's left to fight for?
when i look inside
the nothingness confronts me
vexed by the hands of time

this is survival
i against i
what's left inside?
what's left inside?
what's left inside?

so i slip below
i can't resist the undertow
so i slip below
i can't resist
i can't resist
i can't resist
i can't resist
no

i can feel the deadweight
i can feel the deadweight of my soul
dragging me from this world

Allehelgens Dod I Helveds Rike|Dimmu Borgir|metal|"(norske)

uren er aktens utfoldelse og tanke
uten hemning i ukjent ekstase
ei ett tilbørlig ønske om å avle avkom for gud
frivillig nedsmittet og gjennomsyret
i kjødelig sødme
fengslet av løgn og ulydighet

menneskets skrøpelige atferd
må tuktes med heder og ære blir det sagt
men godhet fødte evig ondskap kun
da edens tyrann skjenket frukten

visdom berikes fritt i dyrets mangfold
når himmerikets salige urett
og svulstige barmhjertighet
vekker forkastelse ved vårt åsyn

gnisten har slått flamme
og piner i pestilensens vilje
de ynkelige slaver knelende i skam
besvangret med skyld og miskunn

ætlinger som sverger eden
med troskapsløfte om å ugjøre freden
å styrte himmelslavers velvære
og triumfere i kulde til dyrets ære

vredens beger renner over
i forherdelse fra opprørdjevlers svovelvind
glødende, fra regionen av belial's barn
avlet hinsides harmens trossende tind

de siste tegn fra kristi tapende engler
brenner ubønnhørlig i ravnens ild

(repeat 2nd verse)
smertefull og blek er døden
med blodstyrtning fra lysets gild
dødens fremmøte sparer ingen
det fromme liv kveles av egne tunger
den kosteligste jord blir pyntet
med fattigdom og hunger

utspente vinger over mørkets dype svelg
satt til verden for å meske seg
med pest og død
fråtsende i synd og hor

overmakten fra pølens bastarder
nærer behag i syndens hierarki
et evig liv i paradis
er fullkommenhet i satans dynasti"

i was at one with a blackening moonlit

i saw a raven circle

born out of thorns to the surface world
mesmerizing strength
to fly among the blackest rain
and soar into the deepest gorge

for this i would battle kingly palaces
for they learn to be false
and outshine it all that i once knew

circling above the open sky
to fly among the blackest rain
in the under dark
to soar into the deepest gorge

anger rideth with the one that knows no fear
who's eyes like fire - who's hearts like ice

spirits rideth with the ones that knows no fear

choke out the fucking noise like i was cursed
it felt like storms were directly overhead
and where i went it poured


and in a flash came the flood
that washed over my eyes
now i could see inside the room of the blind
i lost myself inside
and as i fell into the black i left my past to die


tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
and let the stars fall down
you'll put your head in my arms as we wonder:
is there anything we could've done?
why not try, to start a revolution?
and in the morning find a new sunrise
tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
and watch the stars fall down
as our world ignites!


what will we do? will we just sit back and watch?
i'm sick of apathy dictating how i think and how i talk
i'd like to know as i lay down to die
i still control the way the think, before they make up my mind
as i gaze up towards the sky
i feel lost in the world of the blinding lights
we all hope to reach these heights
but we're all so afraid of the fall
no one will take the fall
we're all so comfortable with living in our sheltered homes
no one will take the fall
but if we try, we could all change the world


tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
and let the stars fall down
you'll put your head in my arms as we wonder:
is there anything we could've done?
why not try to start a revolution?
and in the morning find a new sunrise
tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
and watch the stars fall down

we are gathered here today as brothers and sisters
not bound by fate
but by the understanding that our survival
lies only in harmony


we, have only one life to live
and then we're cast into the night
will you carry the torch and
be the keeper of the light?!
or will you let darkness fall?!
or will you let darkness fall?!
tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world

this judgment creates the pain we hold
destructive intentions that serve no purpose but the end of us all

we're building connective tissue to a maze of lies


we're left as starving orphans, the vital core is gone

it looks a lot like a grave when i'm staring up
feeling the soil creeping over me
there were times at the top of the earth that i wished i could throw
everyone and everything
watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites
i'm bathing in the thought of it
i’d like a reason just to help them bleed
give me a reason, come on give it to me


give me a reason, fucking give me a reason
ah-ah give me a reason, come on give it to me


fly past the trees
far from the leaves
fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe
far from the leaves, transcend these earthly boundaries
and is it this desire that you're looking for?
or is insanity is knocking at your door?
yeah, give me just a piece and surely you will find
everything is better on the other side
but can you look within and find what is in store?
this life is but a scream that has become your whore
it's tearing a hole inside (you're buried alive!)


yeah, there’s a crack in the earth, there’s a crack in the earth, yeah
i’d like a reason just to help them bleed
give me a reason, come on give it to me"
