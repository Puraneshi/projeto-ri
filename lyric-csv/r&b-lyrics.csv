like the thunder, i can hear you whisper
if love has shown, if love was shown, i would be more brave
if i can see anything i wanna entertain
but i can't, i'd rather have you next to me
but can you see that i'm alone
there's no hesitation, i feel you so much
there's no indication that i will choose your touch


there's no song that defines it
there's no music behind it
there's no lyric to read from
there's just you and the moment
lay here closely beside me
feel my heart as it's pounded
we will climax with reason
cause we're grown and we own it


inside the sky of me and you lives a star
let's ride the galaxy and find who we are


i'm hearin them saying things all the time
the word on the street is that i'm slowly losing my mind
they say that he's wasting his whole life


there's no song that defines it
there's no music behind it
there's no lyric to read from
there's just you and the moment
lay here closely beside me
feel my heart as it's pounded
i can climax with reason
cause we're grown and we own it


when the night is through
the morning rays of love i see you through
til the morning dew, yeah, a winter afternoon
a summer night in june, whatever works for you
time goes by, it just can't be more than my love, love
we can, ooh

Breakfast In Bed|Ella Mai|r&b|"
couldn't sleep last night
waking up in cold sweats, reading your last line
now it's six in the morning
and i'm staring at the side of the bed that you're not in
i wonder where you're waking
wonder if you're all alone
don't you wish you could just be right here
waking up where you belong


why you playin' hard to get?
never had to wait this long before
never been the type to fight for more
waking up with no regrets
isn't that what we do this for?
isn't that what we do this for?


so let me take you to my room, i'll give you what you need
i just want to take you home with me
i just want to take this to another level

i just want to give you that, i just want to give you that


why you makin' me beg?
you ain't gotta do me like that, boy it ain't fair
i been trying my hardest
last week you was on it and you wouldn't stop calling
i know what you're thinking
don't want to make it serious
but we don't need a title for what we got here
and the rest is up to us


why you playin' hard to get?
never had to wait this long before
never been the type to fight for more
waking up with no regrets
isn't that what we do this for?

i just want to get you home with me (breakfast in bed)
i just want to give you that, i just want to give you that


on a silver platter when you wake up
high into my realm i wanna take ya
got a lot of tricks, let me break you off
you know what time it is when i take it off
boy you know i got a lot to offer, i ain't never gonna stop you when you wanna come get it
just know i keep it real tight so you can stay for the night wake up, breakfast in bed


so let me take you to my room, i'll give you what you need

she was more than a women, a goddess for all it seems
all i ever needed was her right here loving me
for a while we were cool and the groovin' love was on

what the woman is feeling
was it someone from a distant past? (way back long ago)
'cause it's breaking my heart
to watch her stare into the glass (joe help me out!)


as she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face
i could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way
then she stopped and she came to a page where her diary ends
to smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover i suppose

when you are not with me

if i can't have you, let love set you free
to fly your prettywings around

If You Let Me|Sinead Harnett|r&b|"
hurts me the most when i wake
i fumble and twist, 'til the truth starts to click
there's so much space in this bed
these sheets go for miles: dreams of your smile


i don't wanna be just a memory
and i don't wanna feel your wings break free
because without you i'm lost in the breeze
i gotta be strong now, i gotta show you how


i'll love you like i've never, ever loved somebody
i'll give you things you didn't even know you wanted
don't tell me that it's not enough
my time is up, you're over us
cause i think i might do anything for you
if you just let me, if you just let me
if you just let me, just let me


taste of your lips is still fresh
and the smell of your scent, how could i forget?
your words how they cut me to shreds
but to tell you the truth every piece is for you


i don't wanna be just a memory
and i don't wanna feel your wings break free
because without you i'm lost in the breeze
i gotta be strong now, i gotta show you how

i'll give you things you didn't even know you wanted

miscommunication leads to complication and...
here we are staring at each other as strangers, sleepin' in the same bed
'cause it's like, you were never taught how to use your words like that
you were never taught how to say loving things and caring things
you were just taught how to say what had to be said
so, i want the words that you don't have and i'm stuck trying to figure out what you feel
just think about it, like, what might this life be like if we put our pride to the side and let love lead the way"

Pigment|H.E.R.|r&b|"the things that i would do to you with just a couple seconds
i would color every moment, make you feel like it's forever
i'm comin' over, so you can start undressin'
i'm givin' you a chance to finally make a good impression
on me, yeah
on me, i'll make you feel like it's forever

because it's clear i'm getting bigger
i know you visualize my figure
i was the one that made you look
at your old girl and reconsider
you see me in that black dress
on the first date
and i'm causin' frustration on your mind
only in the best ways

secretly i'm anxious, 'cause the thirst has never been mutual
it's unusual
that someone like you thinks i'm beautiful
it's beautiful, yeah
what we had was beautiful
remember when you said...

the things that i would do to you with just a couple seconds
i would color every moment
make you feel like it's forever baby
i'm coming over so you can start undressing
i hope this is my chance
to finally make a good impression on you, on you

but just when you think you have forever
he has you lost in your emotions
and you hate feeling so alone
and you're sinking because you know
you shouldn't have stayed until the morning
it wasn't worth all of the heartache
it wasn't worth all of the pleasure
because you once were a diamond
he made you feel like buried treasure i guess

nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever baby
nothing lasts forever

the things that i loved to do you with just a couple seconds
you colored every moment, made it feel like it's forever
and after a while we lost a real connection
and i realized there's others using the time
we've been spending no more
i'm still lost, holding in all of the anger at the bottom of the ocean
and i thought you'd be my savior
i was distracted, unaware of his behavior
but when i started drowning i didn't know he was the anchor"
Knock You Down|Keri Hilson|r&b|"
not again
oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me


keep rocking and keep knocking
whether you louboutin'd up or reebokin'
you see the hate that they're serving on a platter
so what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?


i never thought i'd be in love like this
when i look at you, my mind goes on a trip
then you came in and knocked me on my face
feels like in i'm a race, but i already won first place
i never thought i'd fall for you as hard as i did
you got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
every morning, i look at you and smile
'cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down


sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down


i never thought i'd hear myself say
""y'all go ahead, i think i'm gonna kick it with my girl today""
i used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flying high
til i met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
hey, so now i'm crashing
don't know how it happened
but i know it feels so damn good
said if i could go back and make it happen faster
don't you know i would, baby, if i could?
miss independent, to the fullest
the load never too much, she helping me pull it
she shot the bullet that ended that life
i swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
girl, sometimes love...


sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down


tell me now, can you make it past your caspers?
so we can finally fly off into nasa
you was always the cheerleader of my dream
that seem to only date the head of football teams
and i was the class clown that always kept you laughing
we were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
so please don't mess up the trick
hey young world, i'm the new slick rick
they say i move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
let the hourglass pass right into ashes
let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
so i wrote this love letter right before my classes
how could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
for advice, omg, you listen to that bitch
woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'cause we had it, we was magic
i was flying now i'm crashing
this is bad, real bad, michael jackson
now i'm mad, real mad, joe jackson
you should leave your boyfriend now, i'm gon' ask him


so you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
and let it bring a better future than i had in the past
oh, 'cause i don't wanna make the same mistakes i did
i don't wanna fall back on my face again (whoa, whoa)
i'll admit it, i was scared to act to love's call (whoa, whoa)
and if it hits better, make it worth the fall


sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down


won't see it coming when it happens
but when it happens
you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
you see when love comes and knocks you down
yeah
won't see it coming when it happens
but when it happens
you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
you see when love comes and knocks you down
yeah"

Bed Peace|Jhene Aiko|r&b|"
wake up, wake up
gotta get this paper, get this cake up
gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup
gotta act like i care about this fake stuff
straight up what a waste of my day
if i had it my way i'd roll out of bed
say bout 2:30 mid day
hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
you show up right away
we make love and then we fuck
and then you'd give me my space
yeah


what i am trying to say is
that love is ours to make so we should make it
everything else can wait
the time is ours to take so we should take it


wake up, wake up, bake up
gotta heat the vape up
lets get faded
gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
we should just get naked
cause i be working hard and i know you be on that same shit
every other day's a different game that you just can't win
i just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right
so go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
right


what i am trying to say is
(what i am trying to say is)
that love is ours to make so we should make it
(we should make it, we should make it)
everything else can wait
(everything else can wait)
the time is ours to take so we should take it


it's not love, but it's pretty close
hot fudge and a little smoke
i didn't mean it means nothing to you
hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
can't stop on cloud 20
buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
wipe it on my shirt, (haha, on my sleeve)
you tell me that you wanna do it big
i love it when you say ""guess what?"" (what? what?)
reading stories to some other nigga kid
and i wonder why i'm all messed up (up up up up)
cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
being a class act nevermind my alumni
i don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
that i don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
curled up with my head on your chest
it's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
if the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
it will be like this to the kiss of the death
of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
not a good team, once soul, two halves
no joke, who laughs?
just us (just us, just us)


okay, got this oj and jose
mixed it up with that rose
we gon' do this our own way
alright, okay
what is it that you're smoking?
piece it up with this peace and love
and this peace and love like the old days


what i am trying to say is
(what i am trying to say is)
that love is ours to make so we should make it
(we should make it, we should make it)
everything else can wait
(everything else can wait)
the time is ours to take so we should take it


we should stay right here
we should lay right here
cause everything is okay right here
you should stay right here
we should lay right here
cause everything is okay right here"

what do you think my brain is made for
is it just a container for the mind?
this great grey matter

is she just a container for the child?""
that soft pink matter
cotton candy, majin buu, oh, oh, ohh
close my eyes and fall into you, you, you

what if the sky and the stars are for show
and the aliens are watching live
from the purple matter?

and we sparred until we both grew tired
nothing mattered

hey, hey
since you been gone, i been having withdrawals
you were such a habit to call
i ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""naw
she better with some fella with a regular job""
i didn't wanna get her involved
by dinner mr. benjamin was sitting in awe
hopped into my car; drove far
far’s too close and i remember my memory's no sharp
butter knife, what a life, anyway

and we had the time of our lives
then i lost my sight
when i saw you that night
so i’d rather go blind
i’d rather go blind


save your talkin', i know all the facts
tell her it's over and imma take you back
look me right here in my face
cross your heart and say you've changed
but we both know that's not what you want right now
now where you go, where you go, where you go
i will never ever, never know
you just left me here confused
down, depressed and feeling blue
i just hope that you’ll come back home in due time


i’ll be praying, wishing, hoping that you notice me
but now you surrounded by new company
i play it cool, but truth is that's a lie


i’d rather go blind, blind, blind
than to see you with her, tonight
i'm done with your lies

Destiny|Sir Charles Jones|r&b|"the mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. round rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. they grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. sucking, they scatter slowly. children. the swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. whistles call and answer.

the calls wait, my love, and i'll be with you.


the answers round behind the stable.

(a deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in saint vitus' dance. a chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

the children kithoguel salute.

the idiot (lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) grhahute!

the children where's the great light?

the idiot (gobbing.) ghaghahest.

(they release him. he jerks on. a pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. a form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. on a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. a crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. he heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. the crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. a bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. a drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. at a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. a plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. in a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. cissy caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

cissy caffrey



i gave it to molly
because she was jolly,
the leg of the duck
the leg of the duck.


(private cart and private compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. laughter of men from the lane. a hoarse virago retorts.)

the virago signs on you, hairy arse. more power the cavan girl.

cissy caffrey more luck to me. cavan, cootehill and belturbet.

(she sings.)

i gave it to nelly
to stick in her belly
the leg of the duck
the leg of the duck.


(private cart and private compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. stephen dedalus and lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

private compton (jerks his finger.) way for the parson.

private carr (turns and calls.) what ho, parson!

cissy caffrey (her voice soaring higher.)

she has it, she got it,
wherever she put it
the leg of the duck.


(stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

stephen vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. alleluia.

(the famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

the bawd (her voice whispering huskily.) sst! come here till i tell you. maidenhead inside. sst.

stephen (altius aliqantulum) et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

the bawd (spits in their trail her jet of venom.) trinity medicals. fallopian tube. all prick and no pence.

(edy boardman, sniffling, crouched with bertha supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

edy boardman (bickering.) and say the one: i seen you up faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. did you, says i. that's not for you to say, says i. you never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says i. the likes of her! stag that one is. stubborn as a mule! and her walking with two fellows the one time, kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal oliphant.

stephen (triumphaliter.) salvi facti i sunt.

(he flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. a liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. lynch scar's it with a kick.)

lynch so that?

stephen (looks behind.) so that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

lynch pornosophical philotheology. metaphysics in mecklenburg street!

stephen we have shrewridden shakespeare and henpecked socrates. even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

lynch ba!

stephen anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? this movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in omar. hold my stick.

lynch damn your yellow stick. where are we going?

stephen lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, georgina johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

lynch which is the jug of bread? it skills not. that or the customhouse. illustrate thou. here take your crutch and walk.

(they pass. tommy caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. from the top spur he slides down. jacky caffrey clasps to climb. the navvy lurches against the lamp. the twins scuttle off in the dark. the navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

snakes of river fog creep slowly. from drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. a glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. the navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. on the farther side under the railway bridge bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. from gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant nelson's image. a concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru booloohoom. grave gladstone sees him level bloom for bloom. he passes, struck by the stare of truculent wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

at antonio babaiotti's door bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. he disappears. in a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

bloom fish and taters. n. g. ah!

(he disappears into olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. a few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing poldy, blowing bloohoom. in each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper he gasps, standing upright. then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

bloom stitch in my side. why did i run?

(he takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. the glow leaps again.)

bloom what is that? a flasher? searchlight.

(he stands at cormack's corner watching.)

bloom aurora borealis or a steel foundry? ah, the brigade, of course. south side anyhow. big blaze. might be his house. beggar's bush. we're safe. (he hums cheerfully.) london's burning, london's burning! on fire, on fire! (he catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of talbot street.) i'll miss him. run. quick. better cross here.

(he darts to cross the road. urchins shout.)

the urchins mind out, mister! (two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

the bells haltyaltyaltyall.

bloom (halts erect stung by a spasm.) ow.

(he looks round, darts forward suddenly. through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. the motorman bangs his footgong.)

the gong bang bang bla bak blud bugg bloo.

(the brake cracks violently. bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. the motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

the motorman hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

bloom (bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. he brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) no thoroughfare. close shave that but cured the stitch. must take up sandow's exercises again. on the hands down. insure against street accident too. the providential. (he feels his trouser pocket.) poor mamma's panacea. heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. day the wheel of the black maria peeled off my shoe at leonard's corner. third time is the charm. shoe trick. insolent driver. i ought to report him. tension makes them nervous. might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. same style of beauty. quick of him all the same. the stiff walk. true word spoken in jest. that awful cramp in lad lane. something poisonous i ate. emblem of luck. why? probably lost cattle. mark of the beast. (he closes his eyes an instant.) bit light in the head. monthly or effect of the other. brainfogfag. that tired feeling. too much for me now. ow!

(a sinister figure leans on plaited legs against o'beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. from under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

bloom buenos noches, señorita blanca, que calle es esta?

the figure (impassive, raises a signal arm.) password. sraid mabbot.

bloom haha. merci. esperanto. slan leath. (he mutters.) gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(he steps forward. a sackshouldered ragman bars his path. he steps left, ragsackman left.)

bloom i beg. (he swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

bloom keep to the right, right, right. if there is a fingerpost planted by the touring club at stepaside who procured that public boon? i who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the irish cyclist the letter headed, in darkest stepaside. keep, keep, keep to the right. rags and bones, at midnight. a fence more likely. first place murderer makes for. wash off his sins of the world.

(jacky caffrey, hunted by tommy caffrey, runs full tilt against bloom.)

bloom o!

(shocked, on weak hams, he halts. tommy and jacky vanish there, there. bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

bloom beware of pickpockets. old thieves' dodge. collide. then snatch your purse.

(the retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. a sprawled form sneezes. a stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

rudolph second halfcrown waste money today. i told you not go with drunken goy ever. so. you catch no money.

bloom (hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) ja, ich weiss, papachi.

rudolph what you making down this place? have you no soul? (with feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of bloom) are you not my son leopold, the grandson of leopold? are you not my dear son leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers abraham and jacob?

bloom (with precaution.) i suppose so, father. mosenthal. all that's left of him.

rudolph (severely.) one night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. what you call them running chaps?

bloom (in youth's smart blue oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) harriers, father. only that once.

rudolph once! mud head to foot. cut your hand open. lockjaw. they make you kaput, leopoldleben. you watch them chaps.

bloom (weakly.) they challenged me to a sprint. it was muddy. i slipped.

rudolph (with contempt) ooim nachez. nice spectacles for your poor mother!

bloom mamma!

ellen bloom (in pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) o blessed redeemer, what have they done to him! my smelling salts! (she hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. a phial, an agnus dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) sacred heart of mary, where were you at all, at all?

(bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

a voice (sharply.) poldy!

bloom who? (he ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) at your service.

(he looks up. beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in turkish costume stands before him. opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. a wide yells cummerbund girdles her. a white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

bloom molly!

marion welly? mrs marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (satirically.) has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

bloom (shifts from foot to foot.) no, no. not the least little bit.

(he breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. a coin gleams on her forehead. on her feet are jewelled toerings. her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. a silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. he ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in moorish.)

marion nebrakada! feminimum.

(the camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

bloom i can give you... i mean as your business menagerer mrs marion... if you...

marion so you notice some change? (her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. a slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) o poldy, poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! go and see life. see the wide world.

bloom i was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. shop closes early on thursday. but the first thing in the morning. (he pats divers pockets.) this moving kidney. ah!

(he points to the south, then to the east. a cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

the soap

we're a capital couple are bloom and i;
he brightens the earth, i polish the sky.


(the freckled face of sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

sweny three and a penny, please.

bloom yes. for my wife, mrs marion. special recipe.

marion (softly.) poldy!

bloom yes, ma'am?

marion ti trema un poco il cuore?

(in disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from don giovanni)

bloom are you sure about that voglio? i mean the pronunciati...

(he follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. the elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

the bawd ten shillings a maidenhead. fresh thing was never touched. fifteen. there's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(she points. in the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled bridie kelly stands.)

bridie hatch street. any good in your mind?

(with a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. a burly rough pursues with booted strides. he stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

the bawd (her wolfeyes shining.) he's getting his pleasure. you won't get a virgin in the flash houses. ten shillings. don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. sixtyseven is a bitch.

(leering gerty macdowell limps forward. she draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

gerty with all my worldly goods i thee and thou. (she murmurs.) you did that. i hate you.

bloom i? when? you're dreaming. i never saw you.

the bawd leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. writing the gentleman false letters. streetwalking and soliciting. better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

gerty (to bloom.) when you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (she paws his sleeve, slobbering.) dirty married man! i love you for doing that to me.

(she slides away crookedly. mrs breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

mrs breen mr.

bloom (coughs gravely.) madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

mrs breen mr bloom! you down here in the haunts of sin! i caught you nicely! scamp!

bloom (hurriedly.) not so loud my name. whatever do you think me? don't give me away. walls have hears. how do you do? it's ages since i. you're looking splendid. absolutely it. seasonable weather we are having this time of year. black refracts heat. short cut home here. interesting quarter. rescue of fallen women magdalen asylum. i am the secretary...

mrs breen (holds up a finger.) now don't tell a big fib! i know somebody won't like that. o just wait till i see molly! (slily.) account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

bloom (looks behind.) she often said she'd like to visit. slumming. the exotic, you see. negro servants too in livery if she had money. othello black brute. eugene stratton. even the bones and cornerman at the livermore christies. bohee brothers. sweep for that matter.

(tom and sam bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. each has his banjo slung. their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. flashing white kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

there's someone in the house with dina
there's someone in the house, i know,
there's someone in the house with dina
playing on the old banjo.


(they whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

bloom (with a sour tenderish smile.) a little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

mrs breen (screams gaily.) o, you ruck! you ought to see yourself!

bloom for old sake'sake. i only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. you know i had a soft corner for you. (gloomily.) 'twas i sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

mrs breen glory alice, you do look a holy show! killing simply. (she puts out her hand inquisitively.) what are you hiding behind your back? tell us, there's a dear.

bloom (seizes her wrist with his free hand.) josie powell that was, prettiest deb in dublin. how time flies by! do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, old christmas night georgina simpson's housewarming while they were playing the irving bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? subject, what is in this snuff box?

mrs breen you were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. you were always a favourite with the ladies.

bloom (squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) ladies and gentlemen, i give you ireland, home and beauty.

mrs breen the dear dead days beyond recall. love's old sweet song.

bloom (meaningfully dropping his voice.) i confess i'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

mrs breen (gushingly.) tremendously teapot! london's tea pot and i'm simply teapot all over me. (she rubs sides with him.) after the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. under the mistletoe. two is company.

bloom (wearing a purple napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) the witching hour of night. i took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) là ci darem la mano.

mrs breen (in a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) voglio e non. you're hot! you're scalding! the left hand nearest the heart.

bloom when you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. i can never forgive you for that. (his clenched fist at his brow.) think what it means. all you meant to me then. (hoarsely.) woman, it's breaking me! (dennis breen, whitetallhatted, with wisdom hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. little alf bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

alf bergan (points jeering at the sandwich boards.) u.p.: up.

mrs breen (to bloom.) high jinks below stairs. (she gives him the glad eye.) why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? you wanted to.

bloom (shocked.) molly's best friend! could you?

mrs breen (her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) hnhn. the answer is a lemon. have you a little present for me there?

bloom (off handedly.) kosher. a snack for supper. the home without potted meat is incomplete. i was at leah. mrs bandman palmer. trenchant exponent of shakespeare. unfortunately threw away the programme. rattling good place round there for pig's feet. feel.

(richie goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of collis and ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. he ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

richie best value in dub.

(bald pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

pat (advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) steak and kidney. bottle of lager. hee hee hee. wait till i wait.

richie goodgod. inev erate inall...

(with hanging head he marches doggedly forward. the navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

richie (with a cry of pain, his hand to his back) ah! bright's! lights!

bloom (points to the navvy.) a spy. don't attract attention. i hate stupid crowds. i am not on pleasure bent. i am in a grave predicament.

mrs breen humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

bloom i want to tell you a little secret about how i came to be here. but you must never tell. not even molly. i have a most particular reason.

mrs breen (all agog.) o, not for worlds.

bloom let's walk on. shall us?

mrs breen let's.

(the bawd makes an unheeded sign. bloom walks on with mrs breen. the terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

the bawd jewman's melt!

bloom (in an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid saint andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after milly, marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to fairyhouse races, was it?

mrs breen (in smart saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) leopardstown.

bloom i mean, leopardstown. and molly won seven shillings on a three year old named nevertell and coming home along by foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that mrs hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and i'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

mrs breen she did, of course, the cat! don't tell me! nice adviser!

bloom because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that i admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

mrs breen (squeezes his arm, simpers.) naughty cruel i was.

bloom (low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) and molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of mrs joe gallaher's lunch basket. frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, i never cared much for her style. she was .

mrs breen too.

bloom yes. and molly was laughing because rogers and maggot o'reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and marcus tertius moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, dancer moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if i ever heard or read or knew or came across .

mrs breen (eagerly.) yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(she fades from his side. followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. in an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. an armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

the gaffer (crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) and when cairns came down from the scaffolding in beaver street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for derwan's plasterers.

the loiterers (guffaw with cleft palates.) o jays!

(their paintspeckled hats wag. spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

bloom coincidence too. they think it funny. anything but that. broad daylight. trying to walk. lucky no woman.

the loiterers jays, that's a good one. glauber salts. o jays, into the men's porter.

(bloom passes. cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

the whores are you going far, queer fellow? how's your middle leg? got a match on you? eh, come here till i stiffen it for you.

(he plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. from a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. in the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

the navvy (belching.) where's the bloody house?

the shebeenkeeper purdon street. shilling a bottle of stout. respectable woman.

the navvy (gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) come on, you british army!

private carr (behind his back.) he aint half balmy.

private compton (laughs.) what ho!

private carr (to the navvy.) portobello barracks canteen. you ask for carr. just carr.

the navvy (shouts.)

we are the boys. of wexford.

private compton say! what price the sergeantmajor?

private carr bennett? he's my pal. i love old bennett.

thenavvy (shouts.)

the galling chain.
and free our native land.


(he staggers forward, dragging them with him. bloom stops, at fault. the dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

bloom wildgoose chase this. disorderly houses. lord knows where they are gone. drunks cover distance double quick. nice mixup. scene at westland row. then jump in first class with third ticket. then too far. train with engine behind. might have taken me to malahide or a siding for the night or collision. second drink does it. once is a dose. what am i following him for? still, he's the best of that lot. if i hadn't heard about mrs beaufoy purefoy i wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. kismet. he'll lose that cash. relieving office here. good biz for cheapjacks, organs. what do ye lack? soon got, soon gone. might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. can't always save you, though. if i had passed truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. absence of body. still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. what was he? kildare street club toff. god help his gamekeeper.

(he gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend wet dream and a phallic design.)

odd! molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at kingstown. what's that like? (gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. the odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

the wreaths sweet are the sweets. sweets of sin.

bloom my spine's a bit limp. go or turn? and this food? eat it and get all pigsticky. absurd i am. waste of money. one and eightpence too much. (the retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) strange how they take to me. even that brute today. better speak to him first. like women they like rencontres. stinks like a polecat. chacun son goût. he might be mad. fido. uncertain in his movements. good fellow! garryowen! (the wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) influence of his surroundings. give and have done with it. provided nobody. (calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. he unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) sizeable for threepence. but then i have it in my left hand. calls for more effort. why? smaller from want of use. o, let it slide. two and six.

(with regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. the mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. they murmur together.)

the watch bloom. of bloom. for bloom. bloom.

(each lays a hand on blooms shoulder.)

first watch caught in the act. commit no nuisance.

bloom (stammers.) i am doing good to others.

(a covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from liffey slime with banbury cakes in their beaks.)

the gulls kaw kave kankury kake.

bloom the friend of man. trained by kindness.

(he points. bob doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

bob doran towser. give us the paw. give the paw.

(the bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. bob doran falls silently into an area.)

second watch prevention of cruelty to animals.

bloom (enthusiastically.) a noble work! i scolded that tramdriver on harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. bad french i got for my pains. of course it was frosty and the last tram. all tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(signor maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

signor maffei (with a sinister smile.) ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. it was i broke in the bucking broncho ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. lash under the belly with a knotted thong. block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even leo ferox there, the libyan maneater. a redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced fritz of amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (he glares.) i possess the indian sign. the glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (with a bewitching smile.) i now introduce mademoiselle ruby, the pride of the ring.

first watch come. name and address.

bloom i have forgotten for the moment. ah, yes! (he takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) dr bloom, leopold, dental surgeon. you have heard of von bloom pasha. umpteen mil lions. donnerwetter! owns half austria. egypt. cousin.

first watch proof.

(a card falls from inside the leather headband of bloom's hat.)

bloom (in red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the legion of honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) allow me. my club is the junior army and navy. solicitors: messrs john henry menton, 27 bachelor's walk.

first watch (reads.) henry flower. no fixed abode. un lawfully watching and besetting.

second watch an alibi. you are cautioned.

bloom (produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) this is the flower in question. it was given me by a man i don't know his name. (plausibly.) you know that old joke, rose of castille. bloom. the change of name virag. (he murmurs privately and confidentially.) we are engaged you see, sergeant. lady in the case. love entanglement. (he shoulders the second watch gently.) dash it all. it's a way we gallants have in the navy. uniform that does it. (he turns gravely to the first watch.) still, of course, you do get your waterloo sometimes. drop in some evening and have a glass of old burgundy. (to the second watch gaily.) i'll introduce you, inspector. she's game. do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(a dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

the dark mercury the castle is looking for him. he was drummed out of the army.

martha (thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the irish times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) henry! leopold! leopold! lionel, thou lost one! clear my name.

first watch (sternly.) come to the station.

bloom (scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) no, no, worshipful master, light of love. mistaken identity. the lyons mail. lesurques and dubosc. you remember the childs fratricide case. we medical men. by striking him dead with a hatchet. i am wrongfully accused. better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

martha (sobbing behind her veil.) breach of promise. my real name is peggy griffin. he wrote to me that he was miserable. i'll tell my brother, the bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

bloom (behind his hand.) she's drunk. the woman is inebriated. (he murmurs vaguely the past of ephraim.) shitbroleeth.

second watch (tears in his eyes, to bloom.) you ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

bloom gentleman of the jury, let me explain. a pure mare's nest. i am a man misunderstood. i am being made a scapegoat of. i am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. i live in eccles street. my wife, i am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, majorgeneral brian tweedy, one of britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. got his majority for the heroic defence of rorke's drift.

first watch regiment.

bloom (turns to the gallery.) the royal dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. i think i see some old comrades in arms up there among you. the r. d. f. with our own metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

a voice turncoat! up the boers! who booed joe chamberlain?

bloom (his hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) my old dad too was a j.p. i'm as staunch a britisher as you are, sir. i fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general gough in the park and was disabled at spion kop and bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. i did all a white man could. (with quiet feeling.) jim bludso. hold her nozzle again the bank.

first watch profession or trade.

bloom well, i follow a literary occupation. author-journalist. in fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which i am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. i am connected with the british and irish press. if you ring up...

(myles crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. his scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. he dangles a hank of spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

myles crawford (his cock's wattles wagging.) hello, seventyseven eightfour. hello. freeman's urinal and weekly arse wiper here. paralyse europe. you which? bluebags? who writes? is it bloom?

(mr philip beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. he cames a lace portfolio labelled matcham's masterstrokes.)

beaufoy (drawls.) no, you aren't, not by a long shot if i know it. i don't see it, that's all. no born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. one of those, my lord. a plagiarist. a soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. it's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. the beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

bloom (murmurs with hangdog meekness.) that bit about the laughing witch hand in hand i take exception to, if i may... ?

beaufoy (his lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) you funny ass, you! you're too beastly awfully weird for words! i don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. my literary agent mr j. b. pinker is in attendance. i presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? we are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of rheims, who has not even been to a university.

bloom (indistinctly.) university of life. bad art.

beaufoy (shouts.) it's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (he extends his portfolio.) we have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

a voice from the gallery

moses, moses, king of the jews,
wiped his arse in the daily news.


bloom (bravely.) overdrawn.

beaufoy you low cad! you ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (to the court.) why, look at the man's private life! leading a quadruple existence! street angel and house devil. not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. the arch conspirator of the age.

bloom (to the court.) and he, a bachelor, how.

first watch the king versus bloom. call the woman driscoll.

the crier mary driscoll, scullerymaid!

(mary driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. she has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

second watch another! are you of the unfortunate class?

mary driscoll (indignantly.) i'm not a bad one. i bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. i was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with fridays out, and i had to leave owing to his carryings on.

first watch what do you tax him with?

mary driscoll he made a certain suggestion but i thought more of myself as poor as i am.

bloom (in housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) i treated you white. i gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. incautiously i took your part when you were accused of pilfering. there's a medium in all things. play cricket.

mary driscoll (excitedly.) as god is looking down on me this night if ever i laid a hand to them oysters!

first watch the offence complained of? did something happen?

mary driscoll he surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. he held me and i was discoloured in four places as a result. and he interfered twice with my clothing.

bloom she counterassaulted.

mary driscoll (scornfully.) i had more respect for the scouringbrush, so i had. i remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: keep it quiet!

(general laughter.)

georges fottrell (clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) order in court! the accused will now make a bogus statement.

(bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. they would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. he was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. a seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. there might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. an acclimatised britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent british born bairns lisping prayers to the sacred infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(renewed laughter. he mumbles incoherently. reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

longhand and shorthand (without looking up from their notebooks.) loosen his boots.

professor machugh (from the presstable, coughs and calls.) cough it up, man. get it out in bits.

(the crossexamination proceeds re bloom and the bucket. a lace bucket. bloom himself bowel trouble. in beaver street. gripe, yes. quite bad. a plasterers bucket. by walking stifflegged. suffered untold misery. deadly agony. about noon. love or burgundy. yes, some spinach. crucial moment. he did not look in the bucket. nobody. rather a mess. not completely. a titbits back number.)

(uproar and catcalls. bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

j. j. o'molloy (in barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) this is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. we are not in a beargarden nor at an oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. my client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. the trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the pharaoh. prima facie, i put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. i would deal inespecial with atavism. there have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. if the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. he himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. his submission is that he is of mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. not all there, in fact.

bloom (barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) him makee velly muchee fine night. (he begins to lilt simply.)

li li poo lil chile,
blingee pigfoot evly night.
payee two shilly...


(he is howled down.)

j. j. o'molloy (hotly to the populace.) this is a lonehand fight. by hades, i will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. the mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. i say it and i say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. the young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (bloom takes j. j. o'molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) i shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. when in doubt persecute bloom. my client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. he wants to go straight. i regard him as the whitest man i know. he is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at agendath netaim in faraway asia minor, slides of which will now be shown. (to bloom.) i suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

bloom a penny in the pound.

(the mirage of the lake of kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. moses dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

dlugacz (hoarsely.) bleibtreustrasse, berlin, w. 13.

(j. j. o'molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. his face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of john f. taylor. he applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

j. j. o'molloy (almost voicelessly.) excuse me, i am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. a few wellchosen words. (he assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of seymour bushe.) when the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live i say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (a paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

bloom (in court dress.) can give best references. messrs callan, coleman. mr wisdom hely j. p. my old chief joe cuffe. mr v. b. dillon, ex-lord mayor of dublin. i have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . queens of dublin society. (carelessly.) i was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir robert and lady ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. sir bob, i said...

mrs yelverton barry (in lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) arrest him constable. he wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the north riding of tipperary on the munster circuit, signed james lovebirch. he said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as i sat in a box of the theatre royal at a command performance of la cigale. i deeply inflamed him, he said. he made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following thursday, dunsink time. he offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by monsieur paul de kock, entitled the girl with the three pairs of stays.

mrs bellingham (in cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) also to me. yes, i believe it is the same objectionable person. because he closed my carriage door outside sir thornley stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. i had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

mrs yelverton barry shame on him!

(a crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

the sluts and ragamuffins (screaming.) stop thief! hurrah there, bluebeard! three cheers for ikey mo!

second watch (produces handcuffs.) here are the darbies.

mrs bellingham he addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. he lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. he urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

the honourable mrs mervyn talboys (in amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) also me. because he saw me on the polo ground of the phoenix park at the match all ireland versus the rest of ireland. my eyes, i know, shone divinely as i watched captain slogger dennehy of the inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob centaur. this plebeian don juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. i have it still. it represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. he urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. he implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

mrs bellingham me too.

mrs yelverton barry me too.

(several highly respectable dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from bloom.)

the honourable mrs mervyn talboys (stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) i will, by the god above me. i'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as i can stand over him. i'll flay him alive.

bloom (his eyes closing, quails expectantly.) here? (he squirms.) again! (he pants cringing.) i love the danger.

the honourable mrs mervyn talboys very much so! i'll make it hot for you. i'll make you dance jack latten for that.

mrs bellingham tan his breech well, the upstart! write the stars and stripes on it!

mrs yelverton barry disgraceful! there's no excuse for him! a married man!

bloom all these people. i meant only the spanking idea. a warm tingling glow without effusion. refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

the honourable mrs mervyn talboys (laughs derisively.) o, did you, my fine fellow? well, by the living god, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. you have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

mrs bellingham (shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) make him smart, hanna dear. give him ginger. thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. the cat-o' nine-tails. geld him. vivisect him.

bloom (shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) o cold! o shivery! it was your ambrosial beauty. forget, forgive. kismet. let me off this once. (he offers the other cheek.)

mrs yelverton barry (severely.) don't do so on any account, mrs talboys! he should be soundly trounced!

the honourable mrs mervyn talboys (unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) i'll do no such thing. pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! to dare address me! i'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. i'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. he is a wellknown cuckold. (she swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) take down his trousers without loss of time. come here, sir! quick! ready?

bloom (trembling, beginning to obey.) the weather has been so warm.

(davy stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

davy stephens messenger of the sacred heart and evening telegraph with saint patrick's day supplement. containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in dublin.

(the very reverend canon o'hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. before him father conroy and the reverend john hughes s.j. bend low.)

the timepiece (unportalling.)

(the brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

the quoits jigjag, jigajiga. jigjag.

(a panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of martin cunningham, foreman silkhatted, jack power simon dedalus, tom kernan, ned lambert, john henry menton, myles crawford, lenehan, paddy leonard nosey flynn, m'coy and the featureless face of a nameless one.)

the nameless one bareback riding. weight for age. gob, he organised her.

the jurors (all their heads turned to his voice.) really?

the nameless one (snarls.) arse over tip. hundred shillings to five.

the jurors (all their heads lowered in assent.) most of us thought as much.

first watch he is a marked man. another girl's plait cut. wanted: jack the ripper. a thousand pounds reward.

second watch (awed, whispers.) and in black. a mormon. anarchist.

the crier (loudly.) whereas leopold bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(his honour sir frederick falkiner recorder of dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. he bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. from his forehead arise starkly the mosaic ramshorns.)

the recorder i will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid dublin of this odious pest. scandalous! (he dons the black cap.) let him be taken, mr subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in mountjoy prison during his majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the lord have-mercy on your soul. remove him. (a black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(the subsheriff long john fanning appears, smoking a pungent henry clay.)

long john fanning (scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) who'll hang judas iscariot?

(h. rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. a life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. he rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

rumbold (to the recorder with sinister familiarity.) hanging harry, your majesty, the mersey terror. five guineas a jugular. neck or nothing.

(the bells of george's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

the bells heigho! heigho!

bloom (desperately.) wait. stop. gulls. good heart. i saw. innocence. girl in the monkeyhouse. zoo. lewd chimpanzees. (breathlessly.) pelvic basin. her artless blush unmanned me. (overcome with emotion.) i left the precincts. (he turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) hynes, may i speak to you? you know me. that three shillings you can keep. if you want a little more .

hynes (coldly.) you are a perfect stranger.

second watch (points to the corner.) the bomb is here. first watch infernal machine with a time fuse. bloom no, no. pig's feet. i was at a funeral. first watch (draws his truncheon.) liar!

(the beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of paddy dignam. he has gnawed all. he exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. he grows to human size and shape. his dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. his green eyeflashes bloodshot. half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

paddy dignam (in a hollow voice.) it is true. it was my funeral. doctor finucane pronounced life extinct when i succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(he lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

bloom (in triumph.) you hear?

paddy dignam bloom, i am paddy dignam's spirit. list, list, o list!

bloom the voice is the voice of esau.

second watch (blesses himself.) how is that possible?

first watch it is not in the penny catechism.

paddy dignam by metempsychosis. spooks.

a voice o rocks.

paddy dignam (earnestly.) once i was in the employ of mr j. h. menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 bachelor's walk. now i am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. hard lines. the poor wife was awfully cut up. dow is she bearing it? keep her off that bottle of sherry. (he looks round him.) a lamp. i must satisfy an animal need. that buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(the portly figure of john o'connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. beside him stands father coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

father coffey (yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) namine. jacobs vobiscuits. amen.

(paddy dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

paddy dignam pray for the repose of his soul.

(he worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. after him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: dignam's dead and gone below. tom rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

tom rochford (a hand to his breastbone, bows.) reuben j. a florin i find him. (he fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) my turn now on. follow me up to carlow.

(he executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. all recedes. bloom plodges forward again. he stands before a lighted house, listening. the kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

bloom a man's touch. sad music. church music. perhaps here.

(zoe higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

zoe are you looking for someone? he's inside with his friend.

bloom is this mrs mack's?

zoe no, eightyone. mrs cohen's. you might go farther and fare worse. mother slipperslapper. (familiarly.) she's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in oxford. working overtime but her luck's turned today. (suspiciously.) you're not his father, are you?

bloom not i!

zoe you both in black. has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(his skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. a hand slides over his left thigh.)

(her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. she regards it and bloom with dumb moist lips.)

bloom a talisman. heirloom.

zoe for zoe? for keeps? for being so nice, eh?

(she puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. he smiles uneasily. slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. he gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. his smile softens.)

zoe you'll know me the next time.

bloom (forlornly.) i never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. near are lakes. round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. it burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. a fountain murmurs among damask roses. mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. a wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

zoe (murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) schorach ani wenowach, benoith hierushaloim.

bloom (fascinated.) i thought you were of good stock by your accent.

zoe and you know what thought did?

(she bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. the roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

bloom (draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) are you a dublin girl?

zoe (catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) no bloody fear. i'm english. have you a swaggerroot?

bloom (as before.) rarely smoke, dear. cigar now and then. childish device. (lewdly.) the mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

zoe go on. make a stump speech out of it.

bloom (in workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) mankind is incorrigible. sir walter raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. that is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name i forget brought the food. suicide. lies. all our habits. why, look at our public life!

(midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

the chimes turn again, leopold! lord mayor of dublin!

bloom (in alderman's gown and chain.) electors of arran quay, inns quay, rotunda, mountjoy and north dock, better run a tramline, i say, from the cattlemarket to the river. that's the music of the future. that's my programme. cui bono? but our buccaneering vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

an elector three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(the aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

the torch bearers hooray!

(several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with bloom and congratulate him. timothy harrington, late thrice lord mayor of dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor lorcan sherlock, locum tenens. they nod vigorously in agreement.)

late lord mayor harrington (in scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) that alder man sir leo bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. that the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as cow parlour off cork street be henceforth designated boulevard bloom.

councillor lorcan sherlock carried unanimously.

bloom (impassionedly.) these flying dutchmen or lying dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. the poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. but their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(prolonged applause. venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. a streamer bearing the legends cead mille failte and mah ttob melek israel spans the street. all the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. along the route the regiments of the royal dublin fusiliers, the kings own scottish boraerers, the cameron highlanders and the welsh fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. boys from high school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. the pillar of the cloud appears. a fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the kol nidre. the beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. the chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. the van of the procession appears headed by john howard parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the athlone poursuivant and ulster king of arms. they are followed by the right honourable joseph hutchinson, lord mayor of dublin, the lord mayor of cork, their worships the mayors of limerick, galway, sligo and watedord, twentyeight irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the dublin metropolitan fire brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of down and connor his eminence michael cardinal logue archbishop of armagh, primate of all ireland, his grace, the most reverend dr william alexander archbishop of armagh, primate of all ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. after them march gentlemen of the bed chamber black rod, deputy garter gold stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. four buglers on foot blow a sennet. beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. under an arch of triumph bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing saint edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. he is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. wild excitement. the ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. the air is perfumed with essences. the men cheer. bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

william, archbishop of armagh (in purple stock and shovel hat.) will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

bloom (placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) so may the creator deal with me. all this i promise to do.

michael, archbishop of armagh (pours a cruse of hair oil over bloom's head.) gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. habemus carneficem. leopold, patrick, andrew, david, george, be thou anointed!

(bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. he ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. the representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. joybells ring in christ church, saint patrick's, george's and gay malahide. mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. the peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

the peers i do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the koh-i-noor diamond. his palfrey neighs. immediate silence. wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

bloom my subjects! we hereby nominate our faithful charger copula felix hereditary grand vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess selene, the splendour of night.

(the former morganatic spouse of bloom is hastily removed in the black maria. the princess selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a sedan chair borne by two giants. an outburst of cheering.)

john howard parnell (raises the royal standard.) illustrious bloom! successor to my famous brother!

bloom (embraces john howard parnell.) we thank you from our heart, john, for this right royal welcome to green erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(the freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. the keys of dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. he shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

tom kernan you deserve it, your honour.

bloom on this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at ladysmith. our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. half a league onward! they charge! all is lost now! do we yield? no! we drive them headlong! lo! we charge! deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of plevna and, uttering their warcry, bonafide sabaoth, sabred the saracen gunners to a man.

the chapel of freeman typesetters hear! hear!

john wyse nolan there's the man that got away james stephens.

bloom my beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. i, bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. yea, on the word of a bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new bloomusalem in the nova hibernia of the future.

(thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of ireland, under the guidance of derwan the builder construct the new bloomusalem. it is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. in the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. numerous houses are razed to the ground. the inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: l. b. several paupers fall from a ladder. a part of the walls of dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

the sightseers (dying) morituri te salutant. (they die.)

(a man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. he points an elongated finger at bloom.)

the man in the macintosh don't you believe a word he says. that man is leopold m'intosh, the notorious fireraiser. his real name is higgins.

bloom shoot him! dog of a christian! so much for m'intosh!

(a cannonshot. the man in the macintosh disappears. bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. the instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. bloom's bodyguard distribute maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive henry clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of jeyes' fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the world's twelve worst books: froggy and fritz (politic), care of the baby (infantilic), so meals for 7/6 (culinic), was jesus a sun myth?

(many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of nelson's pillar, into the great vat of guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

alexander j. dowie (violently.) fellowchristians and antibloomites, the man called bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. a fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. this vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the apocalypse. a worshipper of the scarlet woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. the stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. caliban!

the mob lynch him! roast him! he's as bad as parnell was. mr fox!

(mother grogan throws her boot at bloom. several shopkeepers from upper and lower dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

bloom (excitedly.) this is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. by heaven, i am guiltless as the unsunned snow! it was my brother henry. he is my double. he lives in number 2 dolphin's barn. slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. i call on my old friend, dr malachi mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

dr mulligan (in motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) dr bloom is bisexually abnormal. he has recently escaped from dr eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. there are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. ambidexterity is also latent. he is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. in consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and i believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. i have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, i declare him to be virgo intacta.

(bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

dr madden hypsospadia is also marked. in the interest of coming generations i suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

dr crotthers i have examined the patient's urine. it is albuminoid. salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

dr punch costello the fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

dr dixon (reads a bill of health.) professor bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. his moral nature is simple and lovable. many have found him a dear man, a dear person. he is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. he has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the reformed priests' protection society which clears up everything. he is practically a total abstainer and i can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. he wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every saturday. he was, i understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in glencree reformatory. another report states that he was a very posthumous child. i appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. he is about to have a baby.

(general commotion and compassion. women faint. a wealthy american makes a street collection for bloom. gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, i.o.u.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

bloom o, i so want to be a mother.

mrs thornton (in nursetender's gown.) embrace me tight, dear. you'll be soon over it. tight, dear.

(bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. they appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. all are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: nasodoro, goldfinger, chrysostomos, maindorée, silversmile, silberselber vifargent, panargros. they are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

(she crosses the threshold. he hesitates. she turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. he hops. on the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. a door on the return landing is thrown open. a man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. averting his face quickly bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows zoe into the musicroom. a shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. the floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. the walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. in the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. with a wand he beats time slowly. kitty ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. a tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

kitty (coughs behind her hand.) she's a bit imbecilic. (she signs with a waggling forefinger.) blemblem. (lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. she settles them down quickly.) respect yourself. (she hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) o, excuse!

zoe more limelight, charley. (she goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

kitty (peers at the gasjet.) what ails it tonight?

lynch (deeply.) enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

zoe clap on the back for zoe.

(the wand in lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. with two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. florry talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. a heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

kitty (hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) o, excuse!

zoe (promptly.) your boy's thinking of you. tie a knot on your shift.

(kitty ricketts bends her head. her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. she snakes her neck, nestling. stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

stephen as a matter of fact it is of no importance whether benedetto marcello found it or made it. the rite is the poet's rest. it may be an old hymn to demeter or also illustrate coela enarrant gloriam domini. it is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round david's that is circe's or what am i saying ceres' altar and david's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. jetez la gourme. faut que jeunesse se passe. (he stops, points at lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) which side is your knowledge bump?

the cap (with saturnine spleen.) bah! it is because it is. woman's reason. jewgreek is greekjew. extremes meet. death is the highest form of life. bah!

stephen you remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. how long shall i continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? whetstone!

the cap bah!

stephen here's another for you. (he frowns.) the reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

the cap which? finish. you can't.

stephen (with on effort.) interval which. is the greatest possible ellipse. consistent with. the ultimate return. the octave. which.

the cap which? (outside the gramophone begins to blare the holy city.)

stephen (abruptly.) what went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. god, the sun, shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. wait a moment. wait a second. damn that fellow's noise in the street. self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. ecco!

lynch (with a mocking whinny of laughter grins at bloom and zoe higgins.) what a learned speech, eh?

zoe (briskly.) god help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(with obese stupidity florry talbot regards stephen.)

florry they say the last day is coming this summer.

kitty no!

zoe (explodes in laughter.) great unjust god!

florry (offended.) well, it was in the papers about anti christ. o, my foot's tickling.

(ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

the newsboys stop press edition. result of the rockinghorse races. sea serpent in the royal canal. safe arrival of antichrist.

(stephen turns and sees bloom.)

stephen a time, times and half a time.

(reuben j. antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. a hobgoblin in the image of punch costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and ally sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

all what?

the hobgoblin (his jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) il vient! c'est moi! l'homme qui rit! l'homme primigene! (he whirls round and round with dervish howls.) sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (he crouches juggling. tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) les jeux son! faits! (the planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) rien n'va plus. (the planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. he springs off into vacuum.)

florry (sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) the end of the world!

(a female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. nebulous obscurity occupies space. through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

the gramophone jerusalem! open your gates and sing hosanna...

(a rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. a white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of elijah. along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the end of the world, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the three lugs of man.)

the end of the world (with a scotch accent.) wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. he thumps the parapet.)

elijah no yapping, if you please, in this booth. jake crane, creole sue, dave campbell, abe kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. say, i am operating all this trunk line. boys, do it now. god's time is 12.25. tell mother you'll be there. rush your order and you play a slick ace. join on right here! book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. just one word more. are you a god or a doggone clod? if the second advent came to coney island are we ready? florry christ, stephen christ, zoe christ, bloom christ, kitty christ, lynch christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. have we cold feet about the cosmos? no. be on the side of the angels. be a prism. you have that something within, the higher self. you can rub shoulders with a jesus, a gautama, an ingersoll. are you all in this vibration? i say you are. you once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. you got me? it's a lifebrightener, sure. the hottest stuff ever was. it's the whole pie with jam in. it's just the cutest snappiest line out. it is immense, supersumptuous. it restores. it vibrates. i know and i am some vibrator. joking apart and getting down to bedrock, a. j. christ dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? o.k. seventyseven west sixtyninth street. got me? that's it. you call me up by sunphone any old time. bumboosers, save your stamps.

the gramophone (drowning his voice.) whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(the disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

the three' whores (covering their ears, squawk.) ahhkkk!

elijah (in rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) big brother up there, mr president, you hear what i done just been saying to you. certainly, i sort of believe strong in you, mr president. i certainly am thinking now miss higgins and miss ricketts got religion way inside them. certainly seems to me i don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, miss florry, just now as i done seed you. mr president, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (he winks at his audience.) our mr president, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

kitty-kate i forgot myself. in a weak moment i erred and did what i did on constitution hill. i was confirmed by the bishop. my mother's sister married a montmorency. it was a working plumber was my ruination when i was pure.

zoe-fanny i let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

florry-teresa it was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of hennessy's three stars i was guilty with whelan when he slipped into the bed.

stephen in the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(the beatitudes, dixon, madden, crotthers, costello, lenehan, bannon, mulligan and lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

the beatitudes (incoherently.) beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

lyster (in quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) he is our friend. i need not mention names. seek thou the light.

(he corantos by. best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. he leads john eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

best (smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) i was just beautifying him, don't you know. a thing of beauty, don't you know. yeats says, or i mean, keats says. (produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. i am out for truth. plain truth for a plain man. tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(in the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of mananaan maclir broods, chin on knees. he rises slowly. a cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. about his head writhe eels and elvers. he is encrusted with weeds and shells. his right hand holds a bicycle pump. his left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

mananaan maclir (with a voice of waves.) aum! hek! wal! ak! lub! mor! ma! white yoghin of the gods. occult pimander of hermes trismegistos. (with a voice of whistling seawind.) punarjanam patsypunjaub! i won't have my leg pulled. it has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of shakti. (with a cry of stormbirds.) shakti, shiva! dark hidden father! (he smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. on its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. he wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) aum! baum! pyjaum! i am the light of the homestead, i am the dreamery creamery butter.

(a skeleton judas hand strangles the light. the green light wanes to mauve. the gasjet wails whistling.)

the gasjet pooah! pfuiiiiii!

(zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

zoe who has a fag as i'm here?

lynch (tossing a cigarette on to the table.) here.

zoe (her head perched aside in mock pride.) is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (she stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. she puffs calmly at her cigarette.) can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

lynch i'm not looking.

zoe (makes sheep's eyes.) no? you wouldn't do a less thing. would you suck a lemon?

(squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. blue fluid again flows over her flesh. bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. kitty ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. lipoti virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. he is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. in his left eye flashes the monocle of cashel boyle o'connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell. on his head is perched an egyptian pshent. two quills project over his ears.)

virag (heels together bows.) my name is virag lipoti, of szombathely. (he coughs thoughtfully, drily.) promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. the injection mark on the thigh i hope you perceived? good.

bloom granpapachi. but...

virag number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, i should opine. backbone in front, so to say. correct me but i always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. in a word. hippogriff. am i right?

bloom she is rather lean.

virag (not unpleasantly.) absolutely! well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. a new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. meretricious finery to deceive the eye. observe the attention to details of dustspecks. never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. parallax! (with a nervous twitch of his head.) did you hear my brain go snap? pollysyllabax!

bloom (an elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) she seems sad.

virag (cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) hoax! beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. lily of the alley. all possess bachelor's button discovered by rualdus colombus. tumble her. columble her. chameleon. (more genially.) well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. there is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. what ho, she bumps! the ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

bloom (regretfully.) when you come out without your gun.

virag we can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. pay your money, take your choice. how happy could you be with either...

bloom with?...

virag (his tongue upcurling.) lyum! look. her beam is broad. she is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. when coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. that suits your book, eh? fleshhotpots of egypt to hanker after. wallow in it. lycopodium. (his throat twitches.) slapbang! there he goes again.

bloom the stye i dislike.

virag (arches his eyebrows.) contact with a goldring, they say. argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old rome and ancient greece in the consulship of diplodocus and ichthyo saurus. for the rest eve's sovereign remedy. not for sale. hire only. huguenot. (he twitches.) it is a funny sound.

(he coughs encouragingly.) but possibly it is only a wart. i presume you shall have remembered what i will have taught you on that head? wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

bloom (reflecting.) wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. this searching ordeal. it has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. wait. i mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

virag (severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. see, you have forgotten. exercise your mnemotechnic. la causa è santa. tara. tara. (aside.) he will surely remember.

bloom rosemary also did i understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. then nay no i have an inkling. the touch of a deadhand cures. mnemo?

virag (excitedly.) i say so. i say so. e'en so. technic. (he taps his parchmentroll energetically.) this book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. virag is going to talk about amputation. our old friend caustic. they must be starved. snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. but, to change the venue to the bulgar and the basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (with a dry snigger.) you intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. pomegranate! from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. pyjamas, let us say? or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (he crows derisively.) keekeereekee!

(bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

bloom i wanted then to have now concluded. nightdress was never. hence this. but tomorrow is a new day will be. past was is today. what now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

virag (prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. pretty poll! (his yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) they had a proverb in the carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. one tablespoonful of honey will attract friend bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. bear's buzz bothers bees. but of this apart. at another time we may resume. we were very pleased, we others. (he coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) you shall find that these night insects follow the light. an illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. for all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my fundamentals of sexology or the love passion which doctor l. b. says is the book sensation of the year. some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. perceive. that is his appropriate sun. nightbird nightsun nighttown. chase me, charley! buzz!

bloom bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job i...

virag (his face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) splendid! spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (he gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) bubbly jock! bubbly jock! where are we? open sesame! cometh forth! (he unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) stay, good friend. i bring thee thy answer redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. i'm the best o'cook. those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. though they stink yet they sting. (he wags head with cackling raillery.) jocular. with my eyeglass in my ocular.

bloom (absently.) ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. always open sesame. the cloven sex. why they fear vermin, creeping things. yet eve and the serpent contradict. not a historical fact. obvious analogy to my idea. serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. like those bubblyjocular roman matrons one reads of in elephantuliasis.

virag (his mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) that the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

bloom i am going to scream. i beg your pardon. ah? so. (he repeats.) spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. ant milks aphis. (profoundly.) instinct rules the world. in life. in death.

virag (head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) who's ger ger? who's dear gerald? o, i much fear he shall be most badly burned. will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (he mews.) luss puss puss puss! (he sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) well, well. he doth rest anon.

ever flying in the spring
round and round a ringaring.
long ago i was a king,
now i do this kind of thing
on the wing, on the wing!

(he rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(from left upper entrance with two sliding steps henry flower comes forward to left front centre. he wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. he carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. he wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. he has the romantic saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. his spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor mario, prince of candia. he settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

henry (in a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) there is a flower that bloometh.

(virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. grave bloom regards zoe's neck. henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

stephen (to himself.) play with your eyes shut. imitate pa. filling my belly with husks of swine. too much of this. i will arise and go to my. expect this is the. steve, thou art in a parlous way. must visit old deasy or telegraph. our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. though our ages. will write fully tomorrow. i'm partially drunk, by the way. (he touches the keys again.) minor chord comes now. yes. not much however.

(almidano artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

artifoni ci rifletta. lei rovina tutto.

florry sing us something. love's old sweet song.

stephen no voice. i am a most finished artist. lynch, did i show you the letter about the lute?

florry (smirking.) the bird that can sing and won't sing.

(the siamese twins, philip drunk and philip sober two oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. both are masked with matthew arnold's face.)

philip sober take a fool's advice. all is not well. work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. mooney's en ville, mooney's sur mer, the moira, larchet's, holles street hospital, burke's. eh? i am watching you.

philip drunk (impatiently.) ah, bosh, man. go to hell! i paid my way. if i could only find out about octaves. reduplication of personality. who was it told me his name?

florry and the song?

stephen spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

florry are you out of maynooth? you're like someone i knew once.

stephen out of it now. (to himself.) clever.

philip drunk and philip sober (their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) clever ever. out of it. out of it. by the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? yes, there it, yes. cleverever outofitnow. keep in condition. do like us.

zoe there was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. you needn't try to hide, i says to him. i know you've a roman collar.

virag perfectly logical from his standpoint. fall of man. (harshly, his pupils waxing.) to hell with the pope! nothing new under the sun. i am the virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. why i left the church of rome. read the priest, the woman and the confessional. penrose. flipperty jippert. (he wriggles.) woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (he cries.) coactus volui. then giddy woman will run about. strong man grasps woman's wrist. woman squeals, bites, spucks. man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (he chases his tail.) piffpaff! popo! (he stops, sneezes.) pchp! (he worries his butt.) prrrrrht!

lynch i hope you gave the good father a penance. nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

zoe (spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) he couldn't get a connection. only, you know, sensation. a dry rush.

bloom poor man!

zoe (lightly.) only for what happened him.

bloom how?

virag (a diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. he lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) verfluchte goim! he had a father, forty fathers. he never existed. pig god! he had two left feet. he was judas iacchias, a libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (he leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) a son of a whore. apocalypse.

kitty and mary shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from jimmy pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

philip drunk (gravely.) qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, philippe?

philip sober (gaily.) c'était le sacré pigeon, philippe.

(kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. and a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. lynch puts on her hat. she whips it off.)

lynch (laughs.) and to such delights has metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

florry (nods.) locomotor ataxy.

zoe (gaily.) o, my dictionary.

lynch three wise virgins.

virag (agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) she sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. panther, the roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (he sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) messiah! he burst her tympanum. (with gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) hik! hek! hak! hok! huk! kok! kuk!

(ben jumbo dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

ben pollard (nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) when love absorbs my ardent soul.

(the virgins, nurse callan and nurse quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

the virgins (gushingly.) big ben! ben macchree!

a voice hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

ben dollard (smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) hold him now.

henry (caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) thine heart, mine love. (he plucks his lutestrings.) when first i saw.

virag (sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) rats! (he yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) after having said which i took my departure. farewell. fare thee well. dreck!

(henry flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

the flybill k. 11. post no bills. strictly confidential. dr hy franks.

henry all is lost now.

(virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

virag's head quack!

(exeunt severally.)

stephen (over his shoulder to zoe.) you would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. but beware antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of anus heresiarchus. the agony in the closet.

lynch all one and the same god to her.

stephen (devoutly.) and sovereign lord of all things.

florry (to stephen.) i'm sure you are a spoiled priest. or a monk.

lynch he is. a cardinal's son.

stephen cardinal sin. monks of the screw.

(his eminence, simon stephen cardinal dedalus, primate of all ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. he wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. his thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

the cardinal

conservio lies captured.
he lies in the lowest dungeon
with manacles and chains around his limbs
weighing upwards of three tons.


(he looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) o, the poor little fellow hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow he was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake but some bloody savage to graize his white cabbage he murdered nell flaherty's duckloving drake.

(a multitude of midges swarms over his robe. he scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) i'm suffering the agony of the damned. by the hoky fiddle, thanks be to jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. if they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(his head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. the dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, easterkissing, zigzag behind him. his voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) shall carry my heart to thee, shall carry my heart to thee, and the breath of the balmy night shall carry my heart to thee.

(the trick doorhandle turns.)

the doorhandle theeee.

zoe the devil is in that door.

(a male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to zoe.)

zoe (sniffs his hair briskly.) hum. thank your mother for the rabbits. i'm very fond of what i like.

bloom (hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) if it were he? after? or because not? or the double event?

zoe (tears open the silverfoil.) fingers was made before forks. (she breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to kitty ricketts and then turns kittenishly to lynch.) no objection to french lozenges? (he nods. she taunts him.) have it now or wait till you get it? (he opens his mouth, his head cocked. she whirls the prize in left circle. his head follows. she whirls it back in right circle. he eyes her.) catch.

(she tosses a piece. with an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

kitty (chewing.) the engineer i was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. full of the best liqueurs. and the viceroy was there with his lady. the gas we had on the toft's hobbyhorses. i'm giddy still.

bloom (in svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) go, go, go, i conjure you, whoever you are.

(a male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. blooms features relax. he places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. zoe offers him chocolate.)

bloom (solemnly.) thanks.

zoe do as you're bid. here.

(a firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

bloom (takes the chocolate.) aphrodisiac? but i thought it. vanilla calms or? mnemo. confused light confuses memory. red influences lupus. colours affect women's characters, any they have. this black makes me sad. eat and be merry for tomorrow. (he eats.) influence taste too, mauve. but it is so long since i. seems new. aphro. that priest. must come. better late than never. try truffles at andrews.

(the door opens. bella cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. she is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like minnie hauck in carmen. on her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. her eyes are deeply carboned. she has a sprouting moustache. her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. she has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

bella my word! i'm all of a mucksweat.

(she glances around her at the couples. then her eyes rest on bloom with hard insistence. her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. her falcon eyes glitter.)

the fan (flirting quickly, then slowly.) married, i see.

bloom yes... partly, i have mislaid .

the fan (half opening, then closing.) and the missus is master. petticoat government.

bloom (looks down with a sheepish grin.) that is so.

the fan (folding together, rests against her eardrop.) have you forgotten me?

bloom yes. no.

the fan (folded akimbo against her waist.) is me her was you dreamed before? was then she him you us since knew? am all them and the same now we? (bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

bloom (wincing.) powerful being. in my eyes read that slumber which women love.

the fan (tapping.) we have met. you are mine. it is fate.

bloom (cowed.) exuberant female. enormously i desiderate your domination. i am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. i stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. the door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. i have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. it runs in our family. poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. he believed in animal heat. a skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. near the end, remembering king david and the sunamite, he shared his bed with athos, faithful after death. a dog's spittle, as you probably... (he winces.) ah!

richie goulding (bagweighted, passes the door.) mocking is catch. best value in dub. fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

the fan (tapping.) all things end. be mine. now.

bloom (undecided.) all now? i should not have parted with my talisman. rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. every phenomenon has a natural cause.

the fan (points downwards slowly.) you may.

bloom (looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) we are observed.

the fan (points downwards quickly.) you must.

bloom (with desire, with reluctance.) i can make a true black knot. learned when i served my time and worked the mail order line for kellet's. experienced hand. every knot says a lot. let me. in courtesy. i knelt once before today. ah!

(bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

bloom (murmurs lovingly.) to be a shoefitter in mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of clyde road ladies. even their wax model raymonde i visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in paris.

the hoof smell my hot goathide. feel my royal weight.

bloom (crosslacing.) too tight?

the hoof if you bungle, handy andy, i'll kick your football for you.

bloom not to lace the wrong eyelet as i did the night of the bazaar dance. bad luck. nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. that night she met... now!

(he knots the lace. bella places her foot on the floor. bloom raises his head. her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. his eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

bloom (mumbles.) awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

bello (with a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) hound of dishonour!

bloom (infatuated.) empress!

bello (his heavy cheekchops sagging.) adorer of the adulterous rump!

bloom (plaintively.) hugeness!

bello dungdevourer!

bloom (with sinews semiflexed.) magnificence.

bello down! (he taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) incline feet forward! slide left foot one pace back. you will fall. you are falling. on the hands down!

bloom (her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) truffles!

(with a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

bello (with bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) feel my entire weight. bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

bloom (enthralled, bleats.) i promise never to disobey.

bello (laughs loudly.) holy smoke! you little know what's in store for you. i'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! i'll bet kentucky cocktails all round i shame it out of you, old son. cheek me, i dare you. if you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

zoe (widening her slip to screen her.) she's not here.

bloom (closing her eyes.) she's not here.

florry (hiding her with her gown.) she didn't mean it, mr bello. she'll be good, sir.

kitty don't be too hard on her, mr bello. sure you won't, ma'amsir.

bello (coaxingly.) come, ducky dear. i want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (bloom puts out her timid head.) there's a good girly now. (bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) i only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. how's that tender behind? o, ever so gently, pet. begin to get ready.

bloom (fainting.) don't tear my.

bello (savagely.) the nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout i'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the nubian slave of old. you're in for it this time. i'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (his forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) i shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of guinness's porter. (he belches.) and suck my thumping good stock exchange cigar while i read the licensed victualler's gazette. very possibly i shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. it will hurt you.

(he twists her arm. bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

bloom don't be cruel, nurse! don't!

bello (twisting.) another!

bloom (screams.) o, it's hell itself! every nerve in my body aches like mad!

bello (shouts.) good, by the rumping jumping general! that's the best bit of news i heard these six weeks. here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (he slaps her face.)

bloom (whimpers.) you're after hitting me. i'll tell...

bello hold him down, girls, till i squat on him.

zoe yes. walk on him! i will.

florry i will. don't be greedy.

kitty no, me. lend him to me.

(the brothel cook, mrs keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

mrs keoch (ferociously.) can i help? (they hold and pinion bloom.)

bello (squats, with a grunt, on bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) i see keating clay is elected chairman of the richmond asylum and bytheby guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. curse me for a fool that i didn't buy that lot craig and gardner told me about. just my infernal luck, curse it. and that goddamned outsider throwaway at twenty to one. (he quenches his cigar angrily on bloom's ear.) where's that goddamned cursed ashtray?

bloom (goaded, buttocksmothered.) o! o! monsters! cruel one!

bello ask for that every ten minutes. beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (he thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) here, kiss that. both. kiss. (he throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) gee up! a cockhorse to banbury cross. i'll ride him for the eclipse stakes. (he bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) ho! off we pop! i'll nurse you in proper fashion. (he horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) the lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

florry (pulls at bello.) let me on him now. you had enough. i asked before you.

zoe (pulling at florry.) me. me. are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

bloom (stifling.) can't.

bello well, i'm not. wait. (he holds in his breath.) curse it. here. this bung's about burst. (he uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) take that! (he recorks himself) yes, by jingo, sixteen three quarters.

bloom (a sweat breaking out over him.) not man. (he sniffs.) woman.

bello (stands up.) no more blow hot and cold. what you longed for has come to pass. henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. now for your punishment frock. you will shed your male garments, you understand, ruby cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

bloom (shrinks.) silk, mistress said! o crinkly! scrapy! must i tip-touch it with my nails?

bello (points to his whores.) as they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. tape measurements will be taken next your skin. you will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for alice and nice scent for alice. alice will feel the pullpull. martha and mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

bloom (a chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) i tried her things on only once, a small prank, in holles street. when we were hardup i washed them to save the laundry bill. my own shirts i turned. it was the purest thrift.

bello (jeers.) little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? ho! ho! i have to laugh! that secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that mrs miriam dandrade sold you from the shelbourne hotel, eh?

bloom miriam, black. demimondaine.

bello (guffaws.) christ almighty, it's too tickling, this! you were a nicelooking miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as mrs dandrade, about to be violated by lieutenant smythe smythe, mr philip augustus blockwell, m.p., signor laci daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed bert, the liftboy, henry fleury of gordon bennett fame, sheridan, the quadroon cr&aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old trinity, ponto, her splendid newfoundland and bobs, dowager duchess of manorhamilton. (he guffaws again.) christ, wouldn't it make a siamese cat laugh?

bloom (her hands and features working.) it was gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when i was female impersonator in the high school play vice versa. it was dear gerald. he got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. now dearest gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. cult of the beautiful.

bello (with wicked glee.) beautiful! give us a breather! when you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

bloom science. to compare the various joys we each enjoy. (earnestly.) and really it's better the position... because often i used to wet.

bello (sternly.) no insubordination. the sawdust is there in the corner for you. i gave you strict instructions, didn't i? do it standing, sir! i'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! if i catch a trace on your swaddles. aha! by the ass of the dorans you'll find i'm a martinet. the sins of your past are rising against you. many. hundreds.

the sins of the past (in a medley of voices.) he went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the black church. unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to miss dunn at an address in d'olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. by word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. in five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. and by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

bello (whistles loudly.) say! what was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? go the whole hog. puke it out. be candid for once.

(mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, eooloohoom. poldy hock, bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, larry rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

bloom don't ask me. our mutual faith. pleasants street. i only thought the half of the... i swear on my sacred oath...

bello (peremptorily.) answer. repugnant wretch! i insist on knowing. tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! where? how? what time? with how many? i give you just three seconds. one! two! thr... !

bloom (docile, gurgles.) i rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

bello (imperiously.) o get out, you skunk! hold your tongue! speak when you're spoken to.

bloom (bows.) master! mistress! mantamer!

(he lifts his arms. his bangle bracelets fall.)

bello (satirically.) by day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. won't that be nice? (he places a ruby ring on her finger.) and there now! with this ring i thee own. say, thank you, mistress.

bloom thank you, mistress.

bello you will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old mrs keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. drink me piping hot. hop! you will dance attendance or i'll lecture you on your misdeeds, miss ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. you'll be taught the error of your ways. at night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. for such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (he chuckles.) my boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. first, i'll have a go at you myself. a man i know on the turf named charles alberta marsh (i was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the hanaper and petty bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. swell the bust. smile. droop shoulders. what offers? (he points.) for that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (he bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in bloom's vulva.) there's fine depth for you! what, boys? that give you a hardon? (he shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

a bidder a florin!

(dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

a voice one and eightpence too much.

the lacquey barang!

charles alberta marsh must be virgin. good breath. clean.

bello (gives a rap with his gavel.) two bar. rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. fourteen hands high. touch and examine his points. handle him. this downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. if i had only my gold piercer here! and quite easy to milk. three newlaid gallons a day. a pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. his sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. whoa, my jewel! beg up! whoa! (he brands his initial con bloom's croup.) so! warranted cohen! what advance on two bob, gentlemen?

a darkvisaged man (in disguised accent.) hoondert punt sterlink.

voices (subdued.) for the caliph haroun al raschid.

bello (gaily.) right. let them all come. the scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch louis xv heels, the grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. pander to their gomorrahan vices.

bloom (bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) o, i know what you're hinting at now.

bello what else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (he stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of bloom's haunches.) up! up! manx cat! what have we here? where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? sing, birdy, sing. it's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. buy a bucket or sell your pump. (loudly.) can you do a man's job?

bloom eccles street.

bello (sarcastically.) i wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. the tables are turned, my gay young fellow! he is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. he shot his bolt, i can tell you! foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! he's no eunuch. a shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! wait for nine months, my lad! holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! that makes you wild, don't it? touches the spot? (he spits in contempt.) spittoon!

bloom i was indecently treated, i... inform the police. hundred pounds. unmentionable. i.

bello would if you could, lame duck. a downpour we want, not your drizzle.

bloom to drive me mad! moll! i forgot! forgive! moll!... we... still...

bello (ruthlessly.) no, leopold bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in sleepy hollow your night of twenty years. return and see.

(old sleepy hollow calls over the wold.)

sleepy hollow rip van winkle! rip van winkle!

bloom (in tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) i see her! it's she! the first night at mat dillon's! but that dress, the green! and her hair is dyed gold and he.

bello (laughs mockingly.) that's your daughter, you owl, with a mullingar student.

(milly bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

milly my! it's papli! but. o papli, how old you've grown!

bello changed, eh? our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, aunt hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. a man and his men friends are living there in clover. the cuckoos' rest! why not? how many women had you, say? following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. what, you male prostitute? blameless dames with parcels of groceries. turn about. sauce for the goose, my gander, o.

bloom they... i

bello (cuttingly.) their heelmarks will stamp the brusselette carpet you bought at wren's auction. in their horseplay with moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. they will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. and they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from hampton leedom's.

bloom ten and six. the act of low scoundrels. let me go. i will return. i will prove...

a voice swear!

(bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

bello as a paying guest or a kept man? too late. you have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. your epitaph is written. you are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

bloom justice! all ireland versus one! has nobody... ?

(he bites his thumb.)

bello die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. i can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. sign a will and leave us any coin you have. if you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! we'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old cuck cohen, my stepnephew i married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (he explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) we'll manure you, mr flower! (he pipes scoffingly.) byby, poldy! byby, papli!

bloom (clasps his head.) my will power! memory! i have sinned! i have suff... (he weeps tearlessly.)

bello (sneers.) crybabby! crocodile tears!

(bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. the passing bell is heard. darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. m. shulomowitz, joseph goldwater moses herzog, harris rosenberg, m. moisel, j. citron, minnie watchman, 0. mastiansky, the reverend leopold abramovitz, chazen. with swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant bloom.)

the circumcised (in a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) shema israel adonai elohenu adonai echad.

voices (sighing.) so he's gone. ah, yes. yes, indeed. bloom? never heard of him. no? queer kind of chap. there's the widow. that so? ah, yes.

(from the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. the pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over bloom.)

the yews (their leaves whispering.) sister. our sister. ssh.

the nymph (softly.) mortal! (kindly.) nay, dost not weepest!

bloom (crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) this position. i felt it was expected of me. force of habit.

the nymph mortal! you found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, la aurora and karini, musical act, the hit of the century. i was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. i was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. useful hints to the married.

bloom (lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) we have met before. on another star.

the nymph (sadly.) rubber goods. neverrip. brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. corsets for men. i cure fits or money refunded. unsolicited testimonials for professor waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. my bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports mrs gus rublin with photo.

bloom you mean photo bits?

the nymph i do. you bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. and with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

bloom (humbly kisses her long hair.) your classic curves, beautiful immortal. i was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

the nymph during dark nights i heard your praise.

bloom (quickly.) yes, yes. you mean that i... sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. i know i fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. steel wine is said to cure snoring. for the rest there is that english invention, pamphlet of which i received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. it claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (he sighs.) 'twas ever thus. frailty, thy name is marriage.

the nymph (her fingers in her ears.) and words. they are not in my dictionary.

bloom you understood them?

the yews ssh.

the nymph (covers her face with her hand.) what have i not seen in that chamber? what must my eyes look down on?

bloom (apologetically.) i know. soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. the quoits are loose. from gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

the nymph (bends her head.) worse! worse!

bloom (reflects precautiously.) that antiquated commode. it wasn't her weight. she scaled just eleven stone nine. she put on nine pounds after weaning. it was a crack and want of glue. eh? and that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(the sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

the waterfall

poulaphouca poulaphouca
poulaphouca poulaphouca.


the yews (mingling their boughs.) listen. whisper. she is right, our sister. we grew by poulaphouca waterfall. we gave shade on languorous summer days.

john wyse nolan (in the background, in irish national for ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) prosper! give shade on languorous days, trees of ireland!

the yews (murmuring.) who came to poulaphouca with the high school excursion? who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

bloom (pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) i was in my teens, a growing boy. a little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. even a pricelist of their hosiery. and then the heat. there were sunspots that summer. end of school. and tipsycake. halcyon days.

(halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, master donald turnbull, master abraham chatterton, master owen goldberg, master jack meredith, master percy apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to master leopold bloom.)

the halcyon days mackerel! live us again. hurray!

(they cheer.)

bloom (hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) again! i feel sixteen! what a lark! let's ring all the bells in montague street. (he cheers feebly.) hurray for the high school!

the echo fool!

the yews (rustling.) she is right, our sister. whisper. (whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) who profaned our silent shade?

the nymph (coyly through parting fingers.) there! in the open air?

the yews (sweeping downward.) sister, yes. and on our virgin sward.

the nymph (with wide fingers.) o! infamy!

bloom i was precocious. youth. the fauns. i sacrificed to the god of the forest. the flowers that bloom in the spring. it was pairing time. capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. lotty clarke, flaxenhaired, i saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. the wanton ate grass wildly. she rolled downhill at rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. she climbed their crooked tree and i... a saint couldn't resist it. the demon possessed me. besides, who saw?

(staggering bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

staggering bob me. me see.

bloom simply satisfying a need. (with pathos.) no girl would when i went girling. too ugly. they wouldn't play.

(high on ben howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

the nannygoat (bleats.) megegaggegg! nannannanny!

bloom (hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) regularly engaged. circumstances alter cases. (he gazes intently downwards on the water.) thirtytwo head over heels per second. press nightmare. giddy elijah. fall from cliff. sad end of government printer's clerk. (through silversilent summer air the dummy of bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the lion's head cliff into the purple waiting waters.)

the dummymummy bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(far out in the bay between bailey and kish lights the erin's king sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

councillor nanneti (alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) when my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. i have...

bloom done. prff.

the nymph (loftily.) we immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. we are stonecold and pure. we eat electric light. (she arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) spoke to me. heard from behind. how then could you... ?

bloom (pacing the heather abjectly.) o, i have been a perfect pig. enemas too i have administered. one third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. up the fundament. with hamilton long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

the nymph in my presence. the powderpuff. (she blushes and makes a knee.) and the rest.

bloom (dejected.) yes. peccavi! i have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (with sudden fervour.) for why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

the voice of kitty (in the thicket.) show us one of them cushions.

the voice of florry here.

(a grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

the voice of lynch (in the thicket.) whew! piping hot!

the voice of zoe (from the thicket.) came from a hot place.

the voice of virag (a birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) hot! hot! ware sitting bull!

bloom it overpowers me. the warm impress of her warm form. even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. so womanly full. it fills me full.

the waterfall

phillaphulla poulaphouca
poulaphouca poulaphouca.


the yews ssh! sister, speak!

the nymph (eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) tranquilia convent. sister agatha. mount carmel, the apparitions of knock and lourdes. no more desire. (she reclines her head, sighing.) only the ethereal. where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(bloom half rises. his back trousers button snaps.)

the button bip!

(two sluts of the coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

the sluts

o leopold lost the pin of his drawers
he didn't know what to do,
to keep it up,
to keep it up.


bloom (coldly.) you have broken the spell. the last straw. if there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

the yews (their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) deciduously!

the nymph sacrilege! to attempt my virtue! (a large moist stain appears on her robe.) sully my innocence! you are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (she clutches in her robe.) wait, satan. you'll sing no more lovesongs. amen. amen. amen. amen. (she draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) nekum!

bloom (starts up, seizes her hand.) hoy! nebrakada! cat of nine lives! fair play, madam. no pruning knife. the fox and the grapes, is it? what do we lack with your barbed wire? crucifix not thick enough? (he clutches her veil.) a holy abbot you want or brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good mother alphonsus, eh reynard?

the nymph (with a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) poli... !

bloom (calls after her.) as if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. no jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. i tried it. your strength our weakness. what's our stud fee? what will you pay on the nail? you fee men dancers on the riviera, i read. (the fleeing nymph raises a keen.) eh! i have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. and would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? fool someone else, not me. (he sniffs.) but. onions. stale. sulphur. grease.

(the figure of bella cohen stands before him.)

bella you'll know me the next time.

bloom (composed, regards her.) passée. mutton dressed as lamb. lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. a raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. and take some double chin drill. your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. they have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. i'm not a triple screw propeller.

bella (contemptuously.) you're not game, in fact. (her sowcunt barks.) fohracht!

bloom (contemptuously.) clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

bella i know you, canvasser! dead cod!

bloom i saw him, kipkeeper! pox and gleet vendor!

bella (turns to the piano.) which of you was playing the dead march from saul?

zoe me. mind your cornflowers. (she darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) the cat's ramble through the slag. (she glances back.) eh? who's making love to my sweeties? (she darts back to the table.) what's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. bloom approaches zoe.)

bloom (gently.) give me back that potato, will you? zoe forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

bloom (with feeling.) it is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

zoe

give a thing and take it back
god'll ask you where is that
you'll say you don't know
god'll send you down below.


bloom there is a memory attached to it. i should like to have it.

stephen to have or not to have, that is the question.

zoe here. (she hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) those that hides knows where to find.

bella (frowns.) here. this isn't a musical peepshow. and don't you smash that piano. who's paying here?

(she goes to the pianola. stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

stephen (with exaggerated politeness.) this silken purse i made out of the sow's ear of the public. madam, excuse me. if you allow me. (he indicates vaguely lynch and bloom.) we are all in the same sweepstake, kinch and lynch. dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

lynch (calls from the hearth.) dedalus! give her your blessing for me.

stephen (hands bella a coin.) gold. she has it.

bella (looks at the money, then at zoe, florry and kitty.) do you want three girls? it's ten shillings here.

stephen (delightedly.) a hundred thousand apologies. (he fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(bella goes to the table to count the money while stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. zoe bounds over to the table. kitty leans over zoe's neck. lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

florry (strives heavily to rise.) ow! my foot's asleep. (she limps over to the table. bloom approaches.)

bella, zoe. kitty, lynch, bloom (chattering and squabbling.) the gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

stephen (at the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) no bottles! what, eleven? a riddle.

zoe (lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) hard earned on the flat of my back.

lynch (lifting kitty from the table.) come!

kitty wait. (she clutches the two crowns.)

florry and me?

lynch hoopla! (he lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

stephen the fox crew, the cocks flew, the bells in heaven were striking eleven. 'tis time for her poor soul to get out of heaven.

bloom (quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between bella and florry.) so. allow me. (he takes up the pound note.) three times ten. we're square.

bella (admiringly.) you're such a slyboots, old cocky. i could kiss you.

zoe (points.) hum? deep as a drawwell. (lynch bends kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. bloom goes with the poundnote to stephen.)

bloom this is yours.

stephen how is that? le distrait or absentminded beggar. (he fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. an object falls.) that fell.

bloom (stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) this.

stephen lucifer. thanks.

bloom (quietly.) you had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. why pay more?

stephen (hands him all his coins.) be just before you are generous.

bloom i will but is it wise? (he counts.) one, seven, eleven, and five. six. eleven. i don't answer for what you may have lost.

stephen why striking eleven? proparoxyton. moment before the next lessing says. thirsty fox. (he laughs loudly.) burying his grandmother. probably he killed her.

bloom that is one pound six and eleven. one pound seven, say.

stephen doesn't matter a rambling damn.

bloom no, but...

stephen (comes to the table.) cigarette, please. (lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) and so georgina johnson is dead and married. (a cigarette appears on the table. stephen looks at it.) wonder. parlour magic. married. hm. (he strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

lynch (watching him.) you would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

stephen (brings the match nearer his eye.) lynx eye. must get glasses. broke them yesterday. sixteen years ago. distance. the eye sees all flat. (he draws the match away. it goes out.) brain thinks. near: far. ineluctable modality of the visible. (he frowns mysteriously.) hm. sphinx. the beast that has two backs at midnight. married.

zoe it was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

florry (nods.) mr lambe from london.

stephen lamb of london, who takest away the sins of our world.

lynch (embracing kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) dona nobis pacem. (the cigarette slips from stephens fingers. bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

bloom don't smoke. you ought to eat. cursed dog i met. (to zoe.) you have nothing?

zoe is he hungry?

stephen (extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the dusk of the gods.)

hangende hunger,
fragende frau,
macht uns alle kaput.


zoe (tragically.) hamlet, i am thy father's gimlet! (she takes his hand.) blue eyed beauty, i'll read your hand. (she points to his forehead.) no wit, no wrinkles. (she counts.) two, three, mars, that's courage. (stephen shakes his head.) no kid.

lynch sheet lightning courage. the youth who could not shiver and shake. (to zoe.) who taught you palmistry?

zoe (turns.) ask my ballocks that i haven't got. (to stephen.) i see it in your face. the eye, like that. (she frowns with lowered head.)

lynch (laughing, slaps kitty behind twice.) like that. pandy bat.

(twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of father dolan springs up.)

father dolan any boy want flogging? broke his glasses? lazy idle little schemer. see it in your eye.

(mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of don john conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

don john conmee now, father dolan! now. i'm sure that stephen is a very good little boy.

zoe (examining stephen's palm.) woman's hand.

stephen (murmurs.) continue. lie. hold me. caress. i never could read his handwriting except his criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

zoe what day were you born?

stephen thursday. today.

zoe thursday's child has far to go. (she traces lines on his hand.) line of fate. influential friends.

florry (pointing.) imagination.

zoe mount of the moon. you'll meet with a... (she peers at his hands abruptly.) i won't tell you what's not good for you. or do you want to know?

bloom (detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) more harm than good. here. read mine.

bella show. (she turns up bloom's hand.) i thought so. knobby knuckles, for the women.

zoe (peering at bloom's palm.) gridiron. travels beyond the sea and marry money.

bloom wrong.

zoe (quickly.) o, i see. short little finger. henpecked husband. that wrong?

(black liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

black liz gara. klook. klook. klook.

(she sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

bloom (points to his hand.) that weal there is an accident. fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. i was sixteen.

zoe i see, says the blind man. tell us news.

stephen see? moves to one great goal. i am twenty two too. sixteen years ago i twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (he winces.) hurt my hand somewhere. must see a dentist. money?

(zoe whispers to florry. they giggle. bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

florry what?

(a hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by james barton, harmony avenue, donnybrook, trots past. blazes boylan and lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. the ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. sadly over the crossblind lydia douce and mina kennedy gaze.)

the boots (jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) haw, haw, have you the horn?

(bronze by gold they whisper.)

zoe (to florry.) whisper.

(they whisper again.)

(over the well of the car blazes boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from blazes boylan s shoulder.)

lenehan ho! what do i here behold? were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

boylan (seated, smiles.) plucking a turkey.

lenehan a good night's work.

boylan (holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) blazes kate! up to sample or your money back. (he holds out a forefinger.) smell that.

lenehan (smells gleefully.) ah! lobster and mayonnaise. ah!

zoe and florry (laugh together.) ha ha ha ha.

boylan bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) hello, bloom! mrs bloom up yet?

bloom (in a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) i'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

boylan (tosses him sixpence.) here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (he hangs his hat smartly on a peg of bloom's antlered head.) show me in. i have a little private business with your wife. you understand?

bloom thank you, sir. yes, sir, madam tweedy is in her bath, sir.

marion he ought to feel himself highly honoured. (she plops splashing out of the water.) raoul, darling, come and dry me. i'm in my pelt. only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

boylan (a merry twinkle in his eye.) topping!

bella what? what is it?

(zoe whispers to her.)

marion let him look, the pishogue! pimp! and scourge himself! i'll write to a powerful prostitute or bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

bella (laughing.) ho ho ho ho.

boylan (to bloom, over his shoulder.) you can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while i just go through her a few times.

bloom thank you, sir, i will, sir. may i bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (he holds an ointment jar.) vaseline, sir? orangeflower?... lukewarm water?...

kitty (from the sofa.) tell us, florry. tell us. what.

(florry whispers to her. whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

mina kennedy (her eyes upturned.) o, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! o, he simply idolises every bit of her! stuck together! covered with kisses!

lydia douce (her mouth opening.) yumyum. o, he's carrying her round the room doing it! ride a cock horse. you could hear them in paris and new york. like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

kitty (laughing.) hee hee hee.

boylan's voice (sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) ah! gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

marion's voice (hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) o! weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

bloom (his eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) show! hide! show! plough her! more! shoot!

bella, zoe, florry. kitty ho ho! ha ha! hee hee!

lynch (points.) the mirror up to nature. (he laughs.) hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(stephen and bloom gaze in the mirror. the face of william shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

shakespeare (in dignified ventriloquy.) 'tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (to bloom.) thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. gaze. (he crows with a black capon's laugh.) iagogo! how my oldfellow chokit his thursdaymomun. iagogogo!

bloom (smiles yellowly at the whores.) when will i hear the joke?

zoe before you're twice married and once a widower.

bloom lapses are condoned. even the great napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(mrs dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. she holds a scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, freddy whimpering, susy with a crying cods mouth, alice struggling with the baby. she cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

freddy ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

susy mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

shakespeare (with paralytic rage.) weda seca whokilla farst.

(the face of martin cunningham, bearded, refeatures shakespeares beardless face. the marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. under the umbrella appears mrs cunningham in merry widow hat and kimono gown. she glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

mrs cunningham (sings.) and they call me the jewel of asia.

martin cunningham

(gazes on her impassive.) immense! most bloody awful demirep!

stephen et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. queens lay with prize bulls. remember pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. forget not madam grissel steevens nor the suine scions of the house of lambert. and noah was drunk with wine. and his ark was open.

bella none of that here. come to the wrong shop.

lynch let him alone. he's back from paris.

zoe (runs to stephen and links him.) o go on! give us some parleyvoo.

(stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

lynch (pommelling on the sofa.) rmm rmm rmm rrr rrrmmmmm.

florry dreams go by contraries.

bloom (approaching stephen.) look.

stephen no, i flew. my foes beneath me. and ever shall be. world without end. (he cries.) pater! free!

bloom i say, look...

stephen break my spirit, will he? o merde alors! (he cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) hola! hillyho!

(simon dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

simon that's all right. (he swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) ho, boy! are you going to win? hoop! pschatt! stable with those halfcastes. wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. head up! keep our flag flying! an eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (he makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) bulbul! burblblbrurblbl! hai, boy!

(the fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. a stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. the pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. ward union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. from six mile point, flathouse, nine mile stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. the crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

(a dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. the field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. skeleton horses: sceptre, maximum the second, zinfandel, the duke of westminsters shotover, repulse, the duke of beauforts' ceylon, prix de paris. dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, cock of the north, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, garrett deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. his nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

the orange lodges (jeering.) get down and push, mister. last lap! you'll be home the night!

garrett deasy (bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) per vias rectas!

(a yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

the green lodges soft day, sir john! soft day, your honour!

stephen hark! our friend, noise in the street!

yorkshire relish for...


zoe that's me. (she claps her hands.) dance! dance! (she runs to the pianola.) who has twopence?

bloom who'll.

lynch (handing her coins.) here.

stephen (cracking his fingers impatiently.) quick! quick! where's my augur's rod? (he runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

zoe (turns the drumhandle.) there.

(she drops two pennies in the slot. glow pink and violet lights start forth. the drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. professor goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. he sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

zoe (twirls around herself heeltapping.) dance. anybody here for there? who'll dance?

(the pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to my girl's a yorkshire girl. stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes zoe around the waist. florry and bella push the table towards the fireplace. stephen, aiming zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. bloom stands aside. between the curtains, professor maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. with a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. he wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. in his buttonhole is a dahlia. he twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. he places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

maginni the poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. no connection with madam legget byrne's or levinstone's. fancy dress balls arranged. deportment. the katty lanner steps. so. watch me! my terpsichorean abilities. (he minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) tout le monde an avant! révérence! tout le monde en place!

(the prelude ceases. professor goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. the air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. stephen and zoe circle freely. the lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

the pianola two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, sweethearts they'd left behind.

(from a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. the hours of noon follow in amber gold. laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

maginni (clipclaps glovesilent hands.) carré! avant deux! breathe evenly! balance!

(the morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

hours you may touch my.

cavaliers may i touch your?

hours o, but lightly!

cavaliers o, so lightly!

the pianola my little shy little lass has a waist.

(zoe and stephen turn boldly with looser swing. the twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. they are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

maginni avant! huit! traversé! salut! cours de mains! croisé!

(the eight hours steal to the last place. morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. they are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

the bracelets heigho! heigho!

zoe (twisting, her hand to her brow.) o!

maginni los tiroirs! chaîne de dames! la corbeille! dos à dos!

(arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

zoe i'm giddy.

(she frees herself droops on a chair, stephen seizes florry and turns with her.)

maginni boulangère! los ronds! los ponts! chevaux de bois! escargots!

(twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. stephen and florry turn cumbrously.)

maginni dansez avec vos dames! changes de dames! donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! remerciez!

the pianola

best, best of all,
baraabum!


kitty (jumps up.) o, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the mirus bazaar!

(she runs to stephen. he leaves florry brusquely and seizes kitty. a screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. groangrousegurgling toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

the pianola my girl's a yorkshire girl.

zoe yorkshire through and through. come on all!

(she seizes florry and waltzes her.)

stephen pas seul!

(he wheels kitty into lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. all wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. bloombella, kittylynch, florryzoe, jujuby women. stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

the pianola

and wears no fancy clothes.

(the couples fall aside. stephen whirls giddily. room whirls back. eyes closed, he totters. red rails fly spacewards. stars all around suns turn roundabout. bright midges dance on wall. he stops dead.)

stephen ho!

(stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. her hair is scant and lank. she fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. a choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

the choir

liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
iubilantium te virginum...


(from the top of a tower buck mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


buck mulligan she's beastly dead. the pity of it! mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (he upturns his eyes.) mercurial malachi.


the mother (with the subtle smile of death's madness.) i was once the beautiful may goulding. i am dead.


stephen (horrorstruck.) lemur, who are you? what bogey man's trick is this?


buck mulligan (shakes his curling capbell.) the mockery of it! kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. she kicked the bucket. (tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) our great sweet mother! epi oinopa ponton.


the mother (comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) all must go through it, stephen. more women than men in the world. you too. time will come.


stephen (choking with fright, remorse and horror.) they said i killed you, mother. he offended your memory. cancer did it, not i. destiny.


the mother (a green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) you sang that song to me. love's bitter mystery.


stephen (eagerly.) tell me the word, mother, if you know now. the word known to all men.


the mother who saved you the night you jumped into the train at dalkey with paddy lee? who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? prayer is all powerful. prayer for the suffering souls in the ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. repent, stephen.


stephen the ghoul! hyena!


the mother i pray for you in my other world. get dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. years and years i loved you, o my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


zoe (fanning herself with the grate fan.) i'm melting!


florry (points to stephen) look! he's white.


bloom (goes to the window to open it more.) giddy.


the mother (with smouldering eyes.) repent! o, the fire of hell!


stephen (panting.) the corpsechewer! raw head and bloody bones!


the mother (her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) beware! (she raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) beware! god's hand! (a green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in stephen's heart.)


stephen (strangled with rage.) shite! (his features grow drawn and grey and old.)


bloom (at the window.) what?


stephen ah non, par exemple! the intellectual imagination! with me all or not at all. non serviam!


florry give him some cold water. wait. (she rushes out.)


the mother (wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) o sacred heart of jesus, have mercy on him! save him from hell, o divine sacred heart!


stephen no! no! no! break my spirit all of you if you can! i'll bring you all to heel!


the mother (in the agony of her deathrattle.) have mercy on stephen, lord, for my sake! inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on mount calvary.


stephen nothung!


(he hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


the gasjet pwfungg!


bloom stop!


lynch (rushes forward and seizes stephen's hand.) here! hold on! don't run amok!


bella police!


(stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
bella (screams.) after him!


(the two whores rush to the halldoors. lynch and kitty and zoe stampede from the room. they talk excitedly. bloom follows, returns.)


the whores (jammed in the doorway, pointing.) down there.


zoe (pointing.) there. there's something up.


bella who pays for the lamp? (she seizes bloom's coattail.) there. you were with him. the lamp's broken.


bloom (rushes to the hall, rushes back.) what lamp, woman?


a whore he tore his coat.


bella (her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) who's to pay for that? ten shillings. you're a witness.


bloom (snatches up stephen's ashplant.) me? ten shillings? haven't you lifted enough off him? didn't he...


bella (loudly.) here, none of your tall talk. this isn't a brothel. a ten shilling house.


bloom (his hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. he raises the ashplant.) only the chimney's broken. here is all he...


bella (shrinks back and screams.) jesus! don't!


bloom (warding off a blow.) to show you how he hit the paper. there's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. ten shillings!


florry (with a glass of water enters.) where is he?


bella do you want me to call the police?


bloom o, i know. bulldog on the premises. but he's a trinity student. patrons of your establishment. gentlemen that pay the rent. (he makes a masonic sign.) know what i mean? nephew of the vice-chancellor. you don't want a scandal.


bella (angrily.) trinity! coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. are you my commander here? where is he? i'll charge him. disgrace him, i will. (she shouts.) zoe! zoe!


bloom (urgently.) and if it were your own son in oxford! (warningly.) i know.


bella (almost speechless.) who are you incog?


zoe (in the doorway.) there's a row on.


bloom what? where? (he throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) that's for the chimney. where? i need mountain air. (he hurries out through the hall. the whores point. florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. on the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off from the left arrives a jingling hackney car. it slows to in front of the house. bloom at the halldoor perceives corny kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. he averts his face. bella from within the hall uses on her whores. they blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. corny kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. the silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. zoe and kitty still point right. bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. incog haroun al baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. the ashplant marks his stride. a pack of bloodhounds, led by hornblower of trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. he walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. he is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. after him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 c 66 c night watch, john henry menton, wisdom hely, v.b. dillon, councillor nannetti, alexander keyes, larry o'rourke, joe cuffe, mrs o'dowd pisser burke, the nameless one, mrs riordan, the citizen, garryowen, whatdoyoucallhim, strangeface, fellowthatslike, sawhimbefore, chapwith, chris callinan, sir charles cameron, benjamin dollard, lenehan, bartell d'arcy, joe hynes, red murray, editor brayden, t.m. healy, mr justice fitzgibbon, john howard parnell, the reverend tinned salmon, professor joly, mrs breen, denis breen, theodore purefoy, mina purefoy, the westland row postmistress, c.p. m'coy, friend of lyons, hoppy holohan, man in the street, other man in the street, footballboots, pugnosed driver rich protestant lady, davy byrne, mrs ellen m'guinness, mrs joe gallaher george lidwell, jimmy henry on corns, superintendent laracy, father cowley, crofton out of the collector generals, dan dawson, dental surgeon bloom with tweezers, mrs bob doran, mrs kennefick, mrs wyse nolan, john wyse nolan, handsomemamedwomanrubbed againstwidebehindinclonskeatram, the bookseller of sweets of sin, miss dubedatandshedidbedad, mesdames gerald and stanislaus moran of roebuck, the managing clerk of drimmies colonel hayes, mastiansky, citron, penrose, aaron figatner, moses herzog, michael e. geraghty, inspector troy, mrs galbraith, the constable off eccles street corner old doctor brady with stethoscope, the mystery man on the beach, a retriever mrs miriam dandrade and all her lovers.

(at the corner of beaver street beneath the scaffolding bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


stephen (with elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) you are my guests. the uninvited. by virtue of the fifth of george and seventh of edward. history to blame. fabled by mothers of memory.


private carr (to cissy caffrey.) was he insulting you?


stephen addressed her in vocative feminine. probably neuter. ungenitive.
voices no, he didn't. the girl's telling lies. he was in mrs cohen's. what's up? soldiers and civilians.


cissy caffrey i was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. but i'm faithful to the man that's treating me though i'm only a shilling whore.


stephen (catches sight of kitty's and lynch's heads.) hail, sisyphus. (he points to himself and the others.) poetic. neopoetic.


voices she's faithfultheman.


cissy caffrey yes, to go with him. and me with a soldier friend.


private compton he doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. biff him one, harry.


private carr (to cissy.) was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


lord tennyson (in union jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) their's not to reason why.


private compton biff him, harry.


stephen (to private compton. ) i don't know your name but you are quite right. doctor swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. shirt is synechdoche. part for the whole.


cissy caffrey (to the crowd.) no, i was with the private.


stephen (amiably.) why not? the bold soldier boy. in my opinion every lady for example...


private carr (his cap awry, advancing to stephen.) say, how would it be, governor, if i was to bash in your jaw?


stephen (looks up in the sky.) how? very unpleasant. noble art of self-pretence. personally, i detest action. (he waves his hand) hand hurts me slightly. enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(to cissy caffrey.) some trouble is on here. what is it, precisely?


dolly gray (from her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of jericho.) rahab. cook's son, goodbye. safe home to dolly. dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(the soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


bloom (elbowing through the crowd plucks stephen's sleeve vigorously.) come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


stephen (turns.) eh? (he disengages himself) why should i not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (he points his finger.) i'm not afraid of what i can talk to if i see his eye. retaining the perpendicular.


(he staggers a pace back.)


bloom (propping him.) retain your own.


stephen (laughs emptily.) my centre of gravity is displaced. i have forgotten the trick. let us sit down somewhere and discuss. struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of england, have invented arbitration. (he taps his brow.) but in here it is i must kill the priest and the king.


biddy the clap did you hear what the professor said? he's a professor out of the college.


cunty kate i did. i heard that.


biddy the clap he expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


cunty kate indeed, yes. and at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


private carr (pulls himself free and comes forward.) what's that you're saying about my king?


(edward the seventh appears in an archway. he wears a white jersey on which an image of the sacred heart is stitched, with the insignia of garter and thistle, golden fleece, elephant of denmark, skinners' and probyns' horse, lincoln's inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of massachusetts. he sucks a red jujube. he is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in germany. in his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: défense d'uriner. a roar of welcome greets him.)


edward the seventh (slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) peace, perfect peace. for identification bucket in my hand. cheerio, boys. (he turns to his subjects.) we have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. mahak makar a back.


(he shakes hands with private carr, private compton, stephen, bloom and lynch. general applause. edward the seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


private carr (to stephen.) say it again.


stephen (nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) i understand your point of view, though i have no king myself for the moment. this is the age of patent medicine. a discussion is difficult down here. but this is the point. you die for your country, suppose. (he places his arm on private carr's sleeve.) not that i wish it for you. but i say: let my country die for me. up to the present it has done so. i don't want it to die. damn death. long live life!


edward the seventh (levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of joking jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


my methods are new and are causing surprise.
to make the blind see i throw dust in their eyes.


stephen kings and unicorns! (he falls back a pace.) come somewhere and we'll... what was that girl saying?...

private compton eh, harry, give him a kick in the knackers. stick one into jerry.

bloom (to the privates, softly.) he doesn't know what he's saying. taking a little more than is good for him. absinthe, the greeneyed monster. i know him. he's a gentleman, a poet. it's all right.

stephen (nods, smiling and laughing.) gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

private carr i don't give a bugger who he is. private compton we don't give a bugger who he is.

stephen i seem to annoy them. green rag to a bull.

(kevin egan of paris in black spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to stephen.)

kevin egan h'lo. bonjour! the vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(patrice egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

patrice socialiste!

don emile patrizio franz rupert pope hennessy (in medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

bloom (to stephen.) come home. you'll get into trouble.

stephen (swaying.) i don't avoid it. he provokes my intelligence.

biddy the clap one immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

the virago green above the red, says he. wolfe tone.

the bawd the red's as good as the green, and better. up the soldiers! up king edward!

a rough (laughs.) ay! hands up to de wet.

the citizen (with a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

may the god above
send down a cove
with teeth as sharp as razors
to slit the throat
of the english dogs
that hanged our irish leaders.


the croppy boy (the rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

i bear no hate to a living thing,
but love my country beyond the king.


rumbold, demon barber (accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by mrs pearcy to slay mogg. knife with which voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of miss barrow which sent seddon to the gallows.

(he jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

the croppy boy horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(he gives up the ghost. a violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. mrs bellingham, mrs yelverton barry and the honourable mrs mervyn talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

rumbold i'm near it myself. (he undoes the noose.) rope which hanged the awful rebel. ten shillings a time as applied to his royal highness. (he plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) my painful duty has now been done. god save the king!

edward the seventh (dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

on coronation day, on coronation day,
o, won't we have a merry time,
drinking whisky, beer and wine!


private carr here. what are you saying about my king?

stephen (throws up his hands.) o, this is too monotonous! nothing. he wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. money i haven't. (he searches his pockets vaguely.) gave it to someone.

private carr who wants your bleeding money?

stephen (tries to move off.) will some one tell me where i am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à paris. not that i... but by saint patrick!...

(the women's heads coalesce. old gummy granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

stephen aha! i know you, grammer! hamlet, revenge! the old sow that eats her farrow!

old gummy granny (rocking to and fro.) ireland's sweetheart, the king of spain's daughter, alanna. strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (she keens with banshee woe.) ochone! ochone! silk of the kine! (she wails.) you met with poor old ireland and how does she stand?

stephen how do i stand you? the hat trick! where's the third person of the blessed trinity? soggarth aroon? the reverend carrion crow.

cissy caffrey (shrill.) stop them from fighting!

a rough our men retreated.

private carr (tugging at his belt.) i'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

bloom (terrified.) he said nothing. not a word. a pure misunderstanding.

the citizen erin go bragh!

(major tweedy and the citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. both salute with fierce hostility.)

private compton go it, harry. do him one in the eye. he's a proboer.

stephen did i? when?

bloom (to the redcoats.) we fought for you in south africa, irish missile troops. isn't that history? royal dublin fusiliers. honoured by our monarch.

the navvy (staggering past.) o, yes. o, god, yes! o, make the kwawr a krowawr! o! bo!

(casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. major tweedy, moustached like turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. he gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

major tweedy (growls gruffly.) rorke's drift! up, guards, and at them! mahal shalal hashbaz.

private carr i'll do him in.

private compton (waves the crowd back.) fair play, here. make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(massed bands blare garryowen and god save the king.)

cissy caffrey they're going to fight. for me!

cunty kate the brave and the fair.

biddy the clap methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

cunty kate (blushing deeply.) nay, madam. the gules doublet and merry saint george for me!

stephen the harlot's cry from street to street shall weave old ireland's windingsheet.

private carr (loosening his belt, shouts.) i'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

bloom (shakes cissy caffrey's shoulders.) speak, you! are you struck dumb? you are the link between nations and generations. speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

cissy caffrey (alarmed seizes private carr's sleeve.) amn't i with you? amn't i your girl? cissy's your girl. (she cries.) police!

stephen (ecstatically, to cissy caffrey.)

white thy fambles, red thy gan
and thy quarrons dainty is.


voices police!

distant voices dublin's burning! dublin's burning! on fire, on fire!

(brimstone fires spring up. dense clouds roll past. heavy gatling guns boom. pandemonium. troops deploy. gallop of hoofs. artillery. hoarse commands. bells clang. backers shout. drunkards bawl. whores screech. foghorns hoot. cries of valour. shrieks of dying. pikes clash on cuirasses. thieves rob the slain. birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. the midnight sun is darkened. the earth trembles. the dead of dublin from prospect and mount jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. a chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. tom rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. he is followed by a race of runners and leapers. in wild attitudes they spring from the brink. their bodies plunge. factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot yorkshire baraabombs. society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. quakerlyster plasters blisters. it rains dragon's teeth. armed heroes spring up from furrows. they exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: wolfe tone against henry grattan, smith o'brien against daniel o'connell, michael davitt against isaac butt, justin m'carthy against parnell, arthur griffith against john redmond john o'leary against liar o'johnny, lord edward fitzgerald against lord gerald fitzedward, the o'donoghue of the glens against the glens of the donoghue. on an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of saint barbara. black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. from the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. on the altarstone mrs mina purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. father malachi o'flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. the reverend mr hugh c. haines love ma. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

father malachi o'flynn introibo ad altare diaboli.

the reverend mr haines love to the devil which hath made glad my young days.

father malachi o'flynn (takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) corpus meum.

the reverend mr haines love (raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) my body.

(in strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and green factions sing kick the pope and daily, daily sing to mary.)

private carr (with ferocious articulation.) i'll do him in, so help me fucking christ! i'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

old gummy granny (thrusts a dagger towards stephen's hand.) remove him, acushla. at 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and ireland will be free. (she prays.) o good god, take him!

bloom (runs to lynch.) can't you get him away?

lynch he likes dialectic, the universal language. kitty! (to bloom.) get him away, you. he won't listen to me. (he drags kitty away.)

stephen (points.) exit judas. et laqueo se suspendit.

bloom (runs to stephen.) come along with me now before worse happens. here's your stick.

stephen stick, no. reason. this feast of pure reason.

cissy caffrey (pulling private carr.) come on, you're boosed. he insulted me but i forgive him. (shouting in his ear.) i forgive him for insulting me.

bloom (over stephen's shoulder.) yes, go. you see he's incapable.

private carr (breaks loose.) i'll insult him.

(he rushes towards stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. he lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. bloom follows and picks it up.)

major tweedy (loudly.) carbine in bucket! cease fire! salute!

the retriever (barking furiously.) ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

the crowd let him up! don't strike him when he's down! air! who? the soldier hit him. he's a professor. is he hurted? don't manhandle him! he's fainted!

(the retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

what call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? let them go and fight the boers!

the bawd listen to who's talking! hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? he gave him the coward's blow.

(they grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

the retriever (barking.) wow wow wow.

bloom (shoves them back, loudly.) get back, stand back!

private compton (tugging his comrade.) here bugger off, harry. there's the cops!

(two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

first watch what's wrong here?

private compton we were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (the retriever barks.) who owns the bleeding tyke?

cissy caffrey (with expectation.) is he bleeding?

a man (rising from his knees.) no. gone off. he'll come to all right.

bloom (glances sharply at the man.) leave him to me. i can easily...

second watch who are you? do you know him?

private carr (lurches towards the watch.) he insulted my lady friend.

bloom (angrily.) you hit him without provocation. i'm a witness. constable, take his regimental number.

second watch i don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. private compton (pulling his comrade.) here, bugger off, harry. or bennett'll have you in the lockup.

private carr (staggering as he is pulled away.) god fuck old bennett! he's a whitearsed bugger. i don't give a shit for him.

first watch (taking out his notebook.) what's his name?

bloom (peering over the crowd.) i just see a car there. if you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

first watch name and address.

(corny kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

bloom (quickly.) o, the very man! (he whispers.) simon dedalus' son. a bit sprung. get those policemen to move those loafers back.

second watch night, mr kelleher.

corny kelleher (to the watch, with drawling eye.) that's all right. i know him. won a bit on the races. gold cup. throwaway. (he laughs.) twenty to one. do you follow me?

first watch (turns to the crowd.) here, what are you all gaping at? move on out of that.

(the crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

corny kelleher leave it to me, sergeant. that'll be all right. (he laughs, shaking his head.) we were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. what? eh, what?

first watch (laughs.) i suppose so.

corny kelleher (nudges the second watch.) come and wipe your name off the slate. (he lilts, wagging his head.) with my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. what, eh, do you follow me?

second watch (genially.) ah, sure we were too.

corny kelleher (winking.) boys will be boys. i've a car round there.

second watch all right, mr kelleher. good night.

corny kelleher i'll see to that.

bloom (shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (he mumbles confidentially.) we don't want any scandal, you understand. father is a well known, highly respected citizen. just a little wild oats, you understand.

first watch o, i understand, sir.

second watch that's all right, sir.

first watch it was only in case of corporal injuries i'd have had to report it at the station.

bloom (nods rapidly.) naturally. quite right. only your bounden duty.

second watch it's our duty.

corny kelleher good night, men.

the watch (saluting together.) night, gentlemen. (they move off with slow heavy tread.)

bloom (blows.) providential you came on the scene. you have a car?.

corny kelleher (laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) two commercials that were standing fizz in jammet's. like princes, faith. one of them lost two quid on the race. drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. so i landed them up on behan's car and down to nighttown.

bloom i was just going home by gardiner street when i happened to...

corny kelleher (laughs.) sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. no, by god, says i. not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (he laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) thanks be to god we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? hah! hah! hah!

bloom (tries to laugh.) he, he, he! yes. matter of fact i was just visiting an old friend of mine there, virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and i was just making my way home...

(the horse neighs.)

the horse hohohohohohoh! hohohohome!

corny kelleher sure it was behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in mrs cohen's and i told him to pull up and got off to see. (he laughs.) sober hearsedrivers a specialty. will i give him a lift home? where does he hang out? somewhere in cabra, what?

bloom no, in sandycove, i believe, from what he let drop.

(stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. corny kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. bloom in gloom, looms down.)

corny kelleher (scratches his nape.) sandycove! (he bends down and calls to stephen.) eh! (he calls again.) eh! he's covered with shavings anyhow. take care they didn't lift anything off him.

bloom no, no, no. i have his money and his hat here and stick.

corny kelleher ah well, he'll get over it. no bones broken. well, i'll shove along. (he laughs.) i've a rendezvous in the morning. burying the dead. safe home!

the horse (neighs.) hohohohohome.

bloom good night. i'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(corny kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. the horse harness jingles.)

corny kelleher (from the car, standing.) night.

bloom night.

(the jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. the car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. corny kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at blooms plight. the jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. with thumb and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. with a slow nod bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what stephen needs. the car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. corny kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. bloom with his hand assuralooms corny kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. bloom, holding in his hand stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

bloom eh! ho! (there is no answer he bends again.) mr dedalus! (there is no answer.) the name if you call. somnambulist. (he bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) stephen! (there is no answer. he calls again.) stephen!

stephen (groans.) who? black panther vampire. (he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) who... drive... fergus now. and pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(he turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

bloom poetry. well educated. pity. (he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephen's waistcoat.) to breathe. (he brushes the wood shavings from stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) one pound seven. not hurt anyhow. (he listens.) what!

(murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(he stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. a dog barks in the distance. bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. he looks down on stephen's face and form.)

bloom (communes with the night.) face reminds me of his poor mother. in the shady wood. the deep white breast. ferguson, i think i caught. a girl. some girl. best thing could happen him... (he murmurs.)... swear that i will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (he murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. he reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

bloom (wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) rudy!

rudy (gazes unseeing into bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. he has a delicate mauveface. on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)"

to please me and bounce me here to the coast of overseas

Incomplete Kisses|Sampha|r&b|"
those incomplete kisses
were weighing you down with every step
in this house we're sinking
but we're far too numb to really care
the tv keeps glitching
the lights dim down and portals appear
and somehow you step out
to say you're not by yourself now


those incomplete kisses
those incomplete kisses
wait too long, you'll miss it
before long you're missing
don't let your heart hide your story
don't let your mind hide your story
'cause if you deny others inside
it gets harder to move along
moving on


flying high above all your memories
i have a birds-eye view
a child stood at the cemetery
he looks just like you
orange, yellow, purple, blue skies
a painting so true
and i hear those cries
don't you leave me here
don't you leave me here


those incomplete kisses
those incomplete
wait too long, you'll miss it
wait too long
those incomplete kisses
those incomplete
those incomplete kisses
those incomplete kisses
wait too long, you'll miss it
before long, you're missing
don't let your heart hide your story
don't let your mind hide your story
'cause if you deny others inside
it gets harder to move along
moving on


those incomplete kisses
were weighing you down with every step
in this house we're sinking
but we're too far numb to really care
the tv keeps glitching
the lights dim down and portals appear"
Stay Ready (What A Life)|Jhene Aiko|r&b|"


we do not exist in
any other instant
here in this dimension
you and i are meant to be
i have waited lifetimes to find you
now that you're here
i can remind you
of the things you've been dreaming
times two
i promise you
if you just give me 24
man, all i need is 24 hours
i promise you'll want plenty more
you've probably been waiting forever
so how does it sound:
us on the ground
giving you my love?


there's no place quite like here
there's no better time than now
you gotta stay ready
there's no place quite like here
there's no better time than now
that's why i stay ready


tell me find your spot with the warning that i might slip
and when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
ride on me like your pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
i can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
i'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
but if i stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
and yea, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
i'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
we gon' fuck around (mmm), we gon' fuck around
and triple through triplets of babies right now
and that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
that means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
i find myself reading old text messages when i'm bored
we find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
i know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
then i wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this porsche


come to me, come, come to me
look at what you've done to me
you put a gun to me
then you brought the sun to me


shine like blood diamonds
learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
the universe energy doesn't lie
and this chemistry is infinity at a million times
i wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
and after 24 bars, you get 24 hours


there's no place quite like here
there's no better time than now
you gotta stay ready
there's no place quite like here
there's no better time than now
that's why i stay ready


all that i know is right now
nothing's for sure but, right now
gotta get yours like, right now
all that i know is right now
nothing's for sure but, right now
gotta get yours like, right now


all that i know is right now
nothing's for sure but, right now
gotta get yours like, right now


i been through some shit man
but i be on my shit man
i decided
that what you give
is what you're given
so i been tryna do it right
i been doin' like
whatever gets me through the night
what a life
i'm steady always on the go
you steady always on the go
we steady losing all control


what a life
what a life
what a life
what a life


they say
the truth ain't pretty
but coming from that pretty mouth
the truth is fitting
cuz you ain't never talkin loud
and you know plenty
yea you know what i'm talkin bout
cuz you just get me
yea you so pretty
if everything is dipped in gold
then baby it will never grow
everything sweet ain't sugar coated


what a life
what a life
what a life
what a life
what a life
what a life that i've been given
what a life
what a life that i've been living
what a life
what a life we die to live in
what a life"

where'd your love go?
where'd your love go?
where'd your love go?
where'd your love go?
where'd your love, baby?


yeah, but i got a lot to be mad about
got a lot to be a man about, got a lot to pop a xan about
i used to rock hand-me-downs and now i rock standing crowds
but it's hard when you only got fans around and no fam around
and if they are, then their hands are out and they pointing fingers
when i wear this fucking burden on my back
like a motherfucking cap and gown
then i walk up in the bank, pants sagging down
and i laugh at frowns—what they mad about?
cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account
that didn't wear a cap and gown
are you mad 'cause the judge ain't give me more time?
and when i attempted suicide, i didn't die
i remember how mad i was on that day
man, you gotta let it go before it get up in the way
let it go, let it go


i ran into this girl, she said, ""why you always blaming?""
""why you can't just face it?""
""why you always gotta be so mad?"" (be mad, be mad, be mad)
i got a lot to be mad about (be mad, be mad, be mad)


where'd your love go?
where'd your love go?
where'd your love go?
where'd your love go?
where'd your love go?
where'd your love, baby?


i ran into this girl, i said, ""i'm tired of explaining""
man, this shit is draining
but i'm not really allowed to be mad"

i've been talking to myself lately, ooh
i've been talking to myself, ooh
earthbound, and scatter-brained
can i thrive on pocket change?
i've been talking to myself lately, ooh


how'd my own molecules forsake me?
atoms changed behind my back
i should be bold, i should be bold in my logic and reasoning
but i just calculate my intentions
i hope that won't follow me to my old age
i'm a moss-covered stone on a foothill
and i'm tumbling, tumbling


i've been talking to myself lately, ooh
i've been talking to myself, ooh
earthbound, and scatter-brained
can i thrive on pocket change?
i've been talking to myself lately, ooh"

early sun shines through my window
your head's on my pillow, i
spend time feelin' on that booty
caress you so smoothly, i


pussy wet like an ocean, aphrodisiac potion
we both took a sip, both know what this is
just lookin' for affection, add a piece to my collection
and maybe who knows, let's see where this goes
'cause the head's so good, and she brings me peace
we don't talk too much, but that's fine with me


i'm lonely, you're lonely too
exactly what you done to me
just can't let it go
i wanna be alone with you

miserable and painful, way down inside

Where I Wanna Be|Donell Jones|r&b|"
i just left my baby girl a message
sayin' i won't be coming home
i'd rather be alone
she doesn't fully understand me
cause i'd rather leave than to cheat

i can be the man she needs
but there's a lot of lust inside of me
and we've been together since our teenage years
i really don't mean to hurt her, but i need some time
to be alone


but when you love someone
you just don't treat them bad

that you would play a major part
in a decision that's so hard
do i leave, do i stay, do i go?
or think about my life and what matters to me the most
girl, the love that we share is real
but in time your heart will heal
i'm not saying i'm gone, but i
have to find what life is like
without you

Afraid|Xavier Omär|r&b|"

losing love, unrequited
was it truly love? undecided
hard times, i'm broken
past lies, they leave you open
i try, i'm hopeless
at night, no way of coping
with this shredded heart
can i get reparations for the pain?
baby i'm afraid
really i'm afraid

of giving you what they all messed up
my stress up
took them pictures and i dressed up
looking blessed up
you need something and i got you
i spot you
til i see your love is not true
it's not true
and i'm scared of what that feels like
looking stupid out in real life

really i'm afraid

really i'm afraid

god has not given us the spirit of fear
but the spirit of love looking like it's not here
i don't doubt your heart, i just know things change
it just leads to pain, i still bleed the same

i still say i'm fine, but i leave my brain
dont' wanna think no more, i can't defeat my shame
don't wanna play no more, i can't defeat this game
but that phone still rings, can't delete your name

'cuz you give to me
everything i pray for, every single day for
listen to me, honestly
you don't have to wait for me to feel i'm safe or
that i'm ready this time
i want no one else, not ""too"" focused on myself
it's just baby i'm afraid
really i'm afraid


of loving you

Doo Wop (That Thing)|Ms. Lauryn Hill|r&b|"
yo, remember back on the bully
when cats used to harmonize like
yo, yo, my men and my women
don't forget about the deen
sirat al-mustaqeem
yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
if ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
and lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(put them up, put them up)
(put them up, put them up)
(put them up, put them up)


it's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
the one you let hit it and never called you again
'member when he told you he was 'bout the benjamins?
you act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
to begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
like you wasn't down and you called him again?
plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
if you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
talking out your neck, sayin' you're a christian
a muslim, sleeping with the jinn
now that was the sin that did jezebel in
who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
you know i only say it 'cause i'm truly genuine
don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
baby girl, respect is just a minimum
niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
now, lauryn is only human
don't think i haven't been through the same predicament
let it sit inside your head like a million women in philly, penn
it's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
look at where you be in, hair weaves like europeans
fake nails done by koreans
come again

(a win win, come again
a win win, come again)


guys you know you'd better watch out
some girls, some girls are only about
that thing, that thing, that thing
that thing, that thing, that thing


the second verse is dedicated to the men
more concerned with his rims and his timbs than his women
him and his men come in the club like hooligans
don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
the pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
need to take care of they three or four kids
and they face a court case when the child support late
money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
the sneaky, silent men
the punk, domestic violence men
quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?
come again, come again
come again, come again


watch out, watch out
look out, look out
watch out, watch out

class!
hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(no! no, no, i don’t think so)
i say it for me, uh, i’m an adult i say, wait
“you’re too young to be in love, this is silly
you’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
you wear fancy adidas”, i mean, it might be something i don’t know
(it's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
well, you tell me. what’s the difference?
(okay, you can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this: you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(you’re crazy! you fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(you might stop being in love but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(she poetic)
she killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?"

Stuck|Nikayla|r&b|"
gully, my bad bro
cause that realiztic shit is not the way i rock
but life drove me nuts, i gave jesus the wheel, he couldn't make it stop
excuses fake or not, shit can degrade my stock
so since i'm back with the bars, it's right i take a shot
i was just in michigan too, now you in boston g
that's helter skelter but here duck down, cause we don't rock with p
you stopping me? you ain't thinking responsibly
i go for blood, 'cel/cell have you leaking on every artery
wreck shotti p with technology follow me
i take a mac and sip p with steve jobs my g
nikayah said i phoned you, to give dog the beast
the future, from what i see/c p you/u are obsolete
dog with me, all that pride will get you broke to bits
hope you legit, and not acting out some quotes from a script
my focus can drift, if the wrong words flow from your lips
get 'cel sick, think elvis; you'll die over this shit
see his guys showed him this, he ain't know what war bring
i show him empathy, poor thing, then pour things
think temptation lead singer if i go to draw king
cause i bet you'll slide out first while i let the four sing
random quotes on ransom notes, no limit is off g
shit i even vacationed march through may
take off spring, brings static we all cling
fuck a joke, bro i won't play with you
talk to my taurus that's what i call a debatable
i feel a way my dude, you could call it hating too
but how is he a new hero? he's incapable
i know all your folks don't get it
yeah my bars fly over your head, but all my shots go in it
think jagerbomb; cause what i bear bro, the shots go in it
open that body bag up and let shot go in it


if you watch me versus skelly, you saw how that shit got out of hand
now usually that stunt will get you stomped out, but i understand
it was obvious why he lunged out, just thank god it was hurt feelings
and that's the reason why the fun stopped, because it could have been curt schilling
another white boy bleeding from one sock
but that's how you commit a homi, make every punch feel like the earth moving
now i'm catching a body in the middle of mass, like a church shooting
but you xcel the god, am i supposed to believe in that, nigga?
boy, you just acting like a god, you morgan freeman-ass nigga!
but i get it bro, life made you this way
if life made you this way
then let's see what death would do
see i respect every body in team homi... except for you
he don't rep a flag, he ain't gangbang, nor letting the cannon shoot
but when i put on the mask, the game changing; crash bandicoot
bitch i came prepared, so you want to rap or scrap?
cause we can make a change of plans, nigga raise yo hands
and shit'll jump off 'cel/cell like shane mcmahon
let's leave it all on the table, that nigga bangz is my son
i'm the nigga he look up to
and tell pass, he don't get a pass, i'll fuck that nigga up too!
i'm from detroit, where bullets fly and murder happens
funny acting niggas die, i should bernie mac 'em
think boston harbor, when he see/sea monsters, he'll know what happens
i'm leaving the god in the water like percy jackson
look at him, he probably think this is a step back
but battling me is a set back
but i don't play though, you can die in the ring; celebrity death match
try to act tough, nah my nigga just rap
or i'm beating shit down his leg, for everything that x lacks/ex lax
king of the dot, will i get charged for beating up a bitch nigga?
cause realiztic told me you be beating up your bitch nigga
you think that makes you a man?
you a little ass boy, and that's a big difference
just imagine a random nigga whipping on your little sister
is should pop his lead put the mil on him like six figures
since he a boston kid, i'm here to pun-ish your son like chris rivers
he thought he was ready, but i knew i had the better style
nigga i'm from seven mile
so you know it get even more disrespectful in my second round
dub nigga


i said speaking of shotti, nikayah i wanted the horroh dude
but my phone be fucking up, he probably heard me wrong it's cool
so i make something out of nothing, cause that's what a god could do
i compare shotti and shotty for a bar or two
call your goons, let your faculty trip
my homis moving cemetery yo shit, now your clique the zombie zoo
dog be cool, if you don't we pull up
bolts locked, scope stocks, chrome cocks, aks that go chop
basically, if war's where it goes, watch
hit yo block, and give shotti/shotty an arsenal/arsonal;
y'all better hope he don't flop/don't flop
your jokes hot, but with the bars, you barely aight boy
ain't it bugged out that you the light version of a white boy?
with me, i'm no joker, go bat shit on a dark night/dark knight
with sharp knives, and i twist 'em while i got them (gotham) in your heart right
then pull down, the blade serrated, it'll rip him to portions
y'all peep that batman shit? well you'll be tripping for sure when i show
you put my name in like some signal of war
if he wasn't supposed to die then why would you commission the/commisioner god then (gordon)
i force in a blade through yo cheek, get that forever smile
you tried to play the villain and died, think heath ledger now
settle down, understand who you are, this my shit kid
boston, we had dirty water before flint did
headshot him, run up where he rest spotting
and give this michigan nigga another lead problem
your threats stopping, offensive lines go with a stretch option
i go for your jugular, to show who's the next problem
boy, there's no remorse when i'm attacking ya
take the battery out the back of ya
the fact is bruh, the fans counted me out, and them jacking ya
got me pissed, so i got to bag p/pee like a catheter
you punishment, i'm just doing what i have to bruh
they could have seen dna get spliced; think gattaca
but you standing here, so you get this kill shot
hold the steel shot, run up be like, ""be still shot""
shit he cooperated too... and nigga still shot
we clear the room, turn a motion picture to a still shot
team homi nigga!


this nigga trash man, just a bunch of light punches and boring schemes
they should of replace your face on the flyer with the jordan meme
no wonder you been dropping tiers/tears
i saw him on bet, and he was so bummy
and i was like ""this nigga's raps gotta be fire.""
but then i found out this nigga's a pathological liar
he no-showed two gzs, claiming that his kid's sick
i heard you lied about it, and if you ask me that's some bitch shit
you be on the phone with gully, storytelling like slick rick
so you skipping battles, you trying to hold a staff
yeah that's how i know he wack
but if it ain't gz it don't count, so i ain't condoning that
king of the dot don't need him, you don't sell ticks/celtics
y'all can len bias, but i'm oding and he still lying, well so be it
the fans can see the snake in 'cel/cell like a nokia
hang it up, last year danny put his career on life support
i'm just up here two-stepping kicking a lifeless corpse
you just keep dying, like you setting trends
y'all seen his battle with p-nut?
don't watch it, it's not some shit i recommend
nigga, p-nut killed you: you should have rolled to oakland with an epipen
but, in the 'yac, he said he homeless, though...
man, that must really suck when it's cold out
but how can you be a man to your daughter when you're not even a man in your own house
nigga knock it off, quit this battle rap character nigga
i fuck with boston, but i'm from a different area nigga
detroit city the most segregated place in america nigga
and i got king of the dot's first airhorn, i'm breaking barriers nigga
but you just another facebook fraud, trying to drop knowledge
every time you make a status, you bugging
you're not a god just because you look like a praying mantis
he thought it was cool to hit on a women, since ray rice happened
so watch me whip a nigga on stage like a daylyt antic
it's zoo faculty, and your crew only as good as your weakest member
so i'ma put him on a t-shirt, that's the only way he'll be remembered
clip so long, that bitch looks like it needs a render
pistol grip and another gun charged like a repeat offender
murder is my hobby, and you about to die for fun nigga
that's exactly what you get, for messing with a dub nigga
dub nigga


yo, we got another nigga, on stage doing this extra shit
rap about b.e.t., my durag on uff and shit
i did get extra pissed, but now, my first question is:
how can you talk down about an opportunity you'll never get?
see the fans say i'm stuck in place and i never see that tier
but every battler knows my bars strike mad fear, get that clear
i rap weird, beauty store; i'll get bagged here
fuck....
fuck is you talking about nigga? this ain't last year!
i see your facade, you here for they laughter: phylicia rashad
i know this bitch, a clear apple, banana to your apple
i could aim a pear/pair at ya and you could watch him swallow a slug, no fear factor
hold up, shotti, slug? y'all know i had to fuck with him
his name's shotti, so he should be used to having slugs in him
burn these, leave your whole party blue, when i'm dumping them
leave his right red, guess now he's republican
take your jaw, put blood in him
leak your jeans; that's blood denim
i'll rusty shiv your liver, they'll transfuse the blood in him
you and wesley snipes, got more in common than being black nigga...
cause we both watch y'all stand behind bars from the tax/tax nigga
you did, but still
matter of fact, i could give you a flash back/flashback
if i back out a calico/calicoe with ill will/ill will and make you rap nigga
why is that nigga? just because i've got the power to
i make food out of you, then devour you
i've got a thousand dollars, you've got hype from a thousand dudes
you in the danger zone/danja zone now, hope they brought the towers/towers through
wow that's rude, a lot of danger? towers through? i'm that nice
spray your whip, if anyone in your car tell/cartel, then black ice
team homi!

round 3: shotti p
last week, i heard you got in a car crash man
but you made it to the battle, i'm glad to see you still alive
naaah i lied, i kind of wished this nigga would of died
round 2, x got exposed, just so y'all can see his lies
but this round, i'ma break down a homi without the csi
there's no way in hell, xcel was killing
you are not impressive, you should focus on your delivery
not about how your bars perfected
you fucking boring, that's why all your battles look like sparring sessions
enough of his footage, and you might end up a narcoleptic
now that's real shit, he was sleeping on me, just cause we on his home court
he didn't know i'll go kimbo and fight niggas on their own porch!
i got lil' niggas on ten speeds, doing drive bys
they'll shoot you for a yoo-hoo and some hot fries
you are not live, so make a choice, how you wanna die nigga?
youtube or fox five?
but you wanna know the real reason i can't rock with you?
cause you think selling lucys and doo-rags is profitable, bro
ain't no way you can convince me, you not the nigga on the doo-rag pack
he only team homi because ill will needed a spot here to buy his doo-rags at
i swear to god, this nigga think he papoose, and he be dropping wisdom
well back to the bars, fuck the jokes, this nigga already is one
i'm from the same city as calicoe, miles mccody and marv won
and boston ain't seen this dope since george young!
you are nothing but excuses, like he ain't stealing money from leagues, that's just rap gossip
he don't like hitting bitches, he just really into slapboxing
i should slide the piece to wifey, it's too late for you to act sorry
i'll get bae to cap a nigga like a frat party
watch me school him, cause he can't fuck with me when i get to spazzing
addicted to smoking a nigga boots, and i can't kick the habit
pornhub; you'll see all types of different ratchets
we'll/wheel pop up, clicking at x window like the system crashing
but what's really cracking? think pet detective; i roll with animals that i'd die for
i'll pull the bitch out a nigga; fingerless iron horn

Against Me|H.E.R.|r&b|"
ay
yeah, yeah, ay, huh
na, na
da da, da da, oh yeah, uh


i should've listened to my intuition
i've put myself in this position
it's all my fault, look in the mirror
think what am i missin'?
seeing thing different, oh am i lost?
feelin' a way, nothing's the same
i wish you would change, oh i'm lost
numbin' the pain, don't make it okay
nothin' to say but-


you brought all the issues (issues)
and i would stay here with you
don't hold it against me ('gainst me)
against me ('gainst me)
hold it against me, against me (yeah)


and i don't trust you lately
and if that makes me crazy
can't hold it against me ('gainst me)
against me ('gainst me)
hold it against me, yeah


feel like i'm driftin'
know he notice the distance and love ain't been blockin' my vision
but that ain't my fault (my fault)
that he was the difference, you let him get in that position
i'm too comfortable now
ain't feelin' a way, nothing's the same
i think every day that we're lost, yeah
ain't love ain't enough but it's holdin' me up
love ain't enough 'cause-


you brought all the issues (yeah)

don't hold it against me ('gainst me)

oh, oh, yeah
('gainst me)


to my women with the utmost respect, intellect
we often forget and neglect intuition can see through elusive intent, listen to it
just listen, just listen, oh
i found myself searching for a way to prevent, the detriment
and giving the impression that if you express to him what a woman needs, his comprehension is definite
but there's a difference between understanding and honoring your word
and i'm articulate, he's a good listener but i'm hesitant 'cause he's gonna fuck up anyways (anyways, anyways, anyways)
baby just listen, listen, listen, oh, woah
and the corners of a man's mind is a place where vulnerability hides
and intimacy is not the act of physical intertwined but it's the isolation of two minds
that's why he keeps his heart and his head seperate
there's only one he can connect with
the multiple names on a checklist, only calls when he's desperate
i guess, it's too much pressure to be respectful and honest
it's too stressful to be keepin' promises and i'm impatient
i'm too high maintenance, way too many expectations when, we're just dating
but i'm special, right?
deny, deny, deny
all you do is lie, word is bond right?
but not with me because i don't know what it's like
i'll never understand the needs of a man or how to nurture
and what she doesn't know can't hurt her
but nah it's deep and you know it
i told you exactly what i wanted
and that love is exhausting but i'm not tired of you yet
oh, no, woah oh, no
to my women with the utmost respect, intellect
we often forget and neglect intuition can see through elusive intent, listen to it"

the vampire in literature

a consideration of the vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. it is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this chapter will serve once for all. in such a story, for example, as dr. m. r. james' count magnus is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? the writer has left the point ambiguous. it is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. it will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain count magnus de la gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrgård. even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. they are warned: ""no, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. they should be resting, not walking."" the two men laughed and cried: ""the count is dead; we do not care for him."" but in the night the villagers ""hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him."" then they hear a hideous laugh, ""it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all."" in the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. ""he was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones."" the other man is standing with his back against a tree, ""pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.""

there was some vague gossip that the count had been ""on the black pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him."" during his investigation of the papers the english traveller, mr. wraxall, found a liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the count had once journeyed to the city of chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. in careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, mr. wraxall exclaims: ""ah, count magnus, there you are. i should dearly like to see you."" he is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. in a state of frenzied fear he sets out for england the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. upon landing at harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. he finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. he is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how ""the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of god; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.""

this story may, i think, certainly be considered as vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural i have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. it is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. no ghost story should be of any length. the horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. the ghost is malevolent and odious. in fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. the authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.

to review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.

since some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in german universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. thus among the poems of heinrich august ossenfelder we have a short piece entitled der vampir, which is as follows:

mein liebes mägdchen glaubet
beständig steif und feste,
an die gegebnen lehren
der immer frommen mutter
als völker an der theyse
an tödtliche vampiere
heyduckisch feste glauben,
nun warte nur christianchen,
du willst mich gar nich lieben;
ich will mich an dir rächen,
und heute in tockayer
zu einem vampir trinken.
und wenn du sanfte schlummerst,
von deinen schönen wangen
den frischen purpur saugen.
alsdenn wirst du erschrecken,
wenn ich dich werde küssen
und als ein vampir küssen:
wann du dann recht erzitterst
und matt in meine arme,
gleich einer todten sinkest
alsdenn will ich dich fragen,
sind meine lehren besser,
als deiner guten mutter?

the poet wieland has a passing reference to the vampire

der jüngling aus den wolken
herab gefallen, stumm und bleich,
als hätt' ein vampyr ihm die adern ausgemolken,
steht ganz vernichtet von dem streich.

it would be an exaggeration to say that the vampire entered german literature with goethe's famous ballad die braut von korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from phlegon of tralles. the young athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:

aus dem grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,
noch zu suchen das vermifste gut,
noch den schon verlornen mann zu lieben und zu saugen seines herzens blut.
ist's um den geschehn,
muss nach andern gehn,
und das junge volk erliegt der wut.

even more famous are the charnel horrors of bürger's lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the gottinger musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof brandl gives an ample list has remained a household word.

in spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary england for german romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of lenore was published here until 1796, when william taylor of norwich printed in the monthly review of march his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. he had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790, and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in norwich literary circles. we know that mrs. barbauld who visited edinburgh ""about the summer of 1793 or 1794"" read aloud taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. this event was described to sir walter scott by miss cranstoun, afterwards countess purgstall, although scott himself mentions that his curiosity ""was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence, had remained impressed on his memory."" this gentleman was mr. cranstoun, the brother of countess purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. it was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that scott made his own rendering of the ballad. the account of taylor's version, ellenore, which ""electrified"" the assembled company at dugald stewart's house when read by the famous anna letitia barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of bürger's works was conveyed to him from hamburg. he immediately devoured the german ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about englishing it. ""i well recollect"" he writes, ""that i began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning."" scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,"" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. in 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from bürger by taylor and by scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of w. r. spencer, h. j. pye and j. t. stanley. the translation by the last named author was given to the public in an édition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown. in 1797, a pasquil followed, miss kitty: a parody on lenora, a ballad, ""translated from the german, by several hands,"" whilst in the following year, mrs. taylor turned the popular poem into italian as a ""novella morale."" probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the rev. j. beresford which was published in 1800.

it was in 1797 that coleridge wrote the first part of christabel, and german critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. for example, if the narrative of geraldine be carefully read it must be evident that the following judgment of professor brandl is without foundation. this critic writes: ""ihre vorgeschichte (of geraldine) schöpfte er grossentheils aus bürgers 'lenore' in taylors uebersetzung: die dame ist, wenigstens ihrer erzählung nach, auf einem windschnellen ross entführt und halbtodt vor furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen leichenzuges, der lenoren auf ihrem ritt durch die mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den schatten der nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte blatt neben ihr wie aus herzenangst.""

as we might expect, the young shelley was enchanted by lenore, and medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand."" dowden tells the story how one christmas eve shelley dramatically related the bürger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture ""working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest ""that the company fully expected to see wilhelm stalk into the parlour."" in his study of shelley, charles middleton has remarked: ""it is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the leonora of bürgher first awakened his poetic faculty. a tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself."" to suggest, as zeiger would have it, that lenore influenced the poem which in the romance st. irvyne megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:

ghosts of the dead! have i not heard your yelling
rise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .

is the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from ""lachin y gair"" in byron's hours of idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.

as i have elsewhere shown in some detail, shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to charlotte dacre's zofloya: or the moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares ""quite enraptured"" him. it is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as die braut von korinth and lenore the novelists of the gothic school, soaked though they were in german literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the vampire. it is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as monk lewis, ""apollo's sexton,"" who would fain ""make parnassus a churchyard""; and charles robert maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions, et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. in the gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: ""surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders."" we have such titles as the famous horrid mysteries; the midnight groan; the abbot of montserrat, or, the pool of blood; the demon of venice; the convent spectre; the hag of the mountains; and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as i am aware, do we meet with the vampire in the realm of gothic fancy. so vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that i hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. there may be some romance which i have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case i am at least prepared to say that the vampire was not generally known to gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school i think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. inevitably one of the band, t. j. horseley carties, francis lathom, william herbert, edward montague, mrs. roche, eliza parsons, miss m. hamilton, mrs. helme, mrs. meeke, isabella kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the vampire in some funereal episode.

one might even have supposed that the notes to southey's thalaba the destroyer, must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in book viii could not have passed unnoticed:

a night of darkness and of storms!
into the chamber of the tomb
thalaba led the old man,
to roof him from the rain.
a night of storms! the wind
swept through the moonless sky,
and moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;
and in the pauses if its sweep
they heard the heavy rain
beat on the monument above.
in silence on oneiza's grave
her father and her husband sate.
the cryer from the minaret
proclaim'd the midnight hour.
""now, now!"" cried thalaba;
and o'er the chamber of the tomb
there spread a lurid gleam,
like the reflection of a sulphur fire
and in that hideous light
oneiza stood before them. it was she . . .
her very lineaments. . . . and such as death
had changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;
but in her eye there dwelt
brightness more terrible
than all the loathsomeness of death.
""still art thou living, wretch? ""
in hollow tones she cried to thalaba;
""and must i nightly leave my grave
to tell thee, still in vain,
god hath abandoned thee?

""this is not she!"" the old man exclaim'd;
""a fiend; a manifest fiend!""
and to the youth he held his lance;
""strike and deliver thyself!""
""strike her!"" cried thalaba,
and palsied of all power,
gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.
""yea, strike her!"" cried a voice, whose tones
flow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,
as when the desert shower
from death deliver'd him;
but obedient to that well-known voice,
his eye was seeking it,
when moath, firm of heart,
perform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse
he thrust his lance; it fell,
and howling with the wound,
its fiendish tenant fled.
a sapphire light fell on them,
and garmented with glory, in their sight
oneiza's spirit stood.

it is important to remark that in his notes upon this passage southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the lettres juives, the vampires of gradisch, also the history of arnold paul, and the very ample account given by tournefort. he further says: ""the turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. if any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he  is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. the merchants (at constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a janisary with them. passing by the burying place of the jews, it happened that an old jew sat by a sepulchre. the janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--roger north's life of sir dudley north.""

it might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the marquis de sade justine, on les malheurs de la vertu and juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. in the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as la nouvelle justine, on les malheurs de la vertu, suivie de l'histoire de juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which justine occupies four and juliette six) justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. in justine we have the episodes in the house of monsieur rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the comte de gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the muscovite giant minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and cordelli, the necrophilist of ancona.

in the new monthly magazine, 1 april, 1819, was published the vampyre: a tale by lord byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in le fanu and m. r. james--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the continent than in england. it was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of lord byron, but had been written by dr. john william polidori, physician-companion to the poet. byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of mrs. shelley's frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in galignani's edition of his works. a first printed, the vampyre forms a part of extracts from ""a letter from geneva, with anecdotes of lord byron."" here is to be read that ""among other things which the lady, from whom i procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by lord byron. it appears that one evening lord byron, mr. p. b. shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of godwin and dr. polidori) before alluded to after having perused a german work, which was entitled phantasmagoriana began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of mr. shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. the physician and lord byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. after having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. it was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by lord byron, the physician, and miss m. godwin. my friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, i obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as i was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the ébauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence."" upon this the editor has the following note: ""we have in our possession the tale of dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of miss godwin. the latter has already appeared under the title of 'frankenstein, or the modern prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.""

the vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. this preamble commences: ""the superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the east. among the arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the greeks until after the establishment of christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the latin and greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. in the west it spread, with some slight variation, all over hungary, poland, austria, and lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.""

the editor then recounts the famous instance of arnold paul, and continues: ""we have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. in many parts of greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. this supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'giaour.'

but first on earth, as vampyre sent,
thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;
then ghastly haunt thy native place,
and suck the blood of all thy race;
there from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283
at midnight drain the stream of life;
yet loathe the banquet, which perforce
must feed thy livid living corse,
thy victims, ere they yet expire,
shall know the demon for their sire;
as cursing thee, thou cursing them,
thy flowers are withered on the stem.
but one that for thy crime must fall,
the youngest, best beloved of all,
shall bless thee with a father's name--
that word shall wrap thy heart in flame!
yet thou must end thy task and mark
her check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,
and the last glassy glance must view
which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
then with unhallowed hand shall tear
the tresses of her yellow hair,
of which, in life a lock when shorn
affection's fondest pledge was worn--
but now is borne away by thee
memorial o thine agony!
yet with thine own best blood shall drip
thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;
then stalking to thy sullen grave
go--and with ghouls and afrits rave,
till these in horror shrink away
from spectre more accursed than they.""

after an allusion to southey's thalaba, tournefort's travels, and dom calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: ""we could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, vroucolocha, vardoulacha, goul, broucoloka, &c.""

the story tells how at the height of a london season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. he gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass."" this original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets ""a young gentleman of the name of aubrey"" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood."" aubrey is greatly fascinated by lord ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the continent he mentions this intention to my lord, and is ""surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.""

as they travelled from town to town, aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. however the recipients of this charity ""inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery."" eventually the travellers arrive at rome, and here aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from london the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. at rome aubrey is able to foil lord ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he ""directed his steps towards greece, and, crossing the peninsula, soon found himself at athens."" here he lodges in the house of a greek, whose daughter ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. as he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with greek legend and tradition, and ""often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. she detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of lord ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of lord ruthven.""

before long it becomes evident that aubrey is in love with ianthe, ""and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of english habits, marrying an uneducated greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him."" he endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. when ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, ""as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. they described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.""

having given his promise to ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. the exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. the steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood. ""as he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound."" with a terrific effort aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness ""found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried ""again baffled,"" to which a loud laugh succeeded, and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him--he instantly rose and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood was not longer heard."" several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene, and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by, the lifeless body of ianthe. a curious dagger lies near, but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon. ""there was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, 'a vampyre, a vampyre!'"" it appears that ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety. aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever, and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss.

whilst aubrey lies ill lord ruthven arrives in athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten, since aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company. together they travel into the wildest interior of greece, and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands, from whose guns lord ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder. his strength strangely decreasing, a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death. he now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach england. ""swear!"" cried the dying man, ""swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see."" aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath, and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter ruthven expires.

according to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way, but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared, and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes. one circumstance, however, gives aubrey much food for thought. among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of ianthe's death.

returning to england, as he retraces his journey through rome to his horror aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken, lord ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness. the lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship, and aubrey instinctively divines that she has ""fallen a victim to the destroyer of ianthe.""

upon his arrival in london the traveller is greeted by his sister, whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. ""it was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene."" upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive, and as aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well, whispers in this ear: ""remember

p. 288

your oath."" turning he sees lord ruthven standing near him. a few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surrounded--the most prominent of the throng--he again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure. hurrying forward he seizes his sister's arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home. however, before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him: ""remember your oath!""

aubrey now becomes almost distracted. he sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death. even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed. whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity. as the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him well-nigh to madness, so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him. he is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath. it so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when miss aubrey is to be married on the following day. he instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the earl of marsden. he requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him. as they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections. to his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of lord ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot. in twenty-four hours the period of his oath will have expired, and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time. since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded, upon which aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint. during the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued. it appears that upon the pretext of being her brother's dearest friend and travelling

p. 289

companion lord ruthven had visited the house to inquire after aubrey during his supposed derangement, and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor. when the bridal party has assembled aubrey, neglected by the servants, contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials. ere he can utter a cry, he is, however, at once perceived by lord ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him, speechless with rage, from the room, at the same time whispering in his ear: ""remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to-day, your sister is dishonoured. women are frail!"" the attendants at once secure the unhappy man, but he can no longer support his distress. in his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed. this sad accident is kept from his sister; the marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left london.

""aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. he desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.

""the guardians hastened to protect miss aubrey; but when they arrived it was too late. lord ruthven had disappeared, and aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a vampyre!""

it were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story, and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit, for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed, nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale, since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved. the first separate edition of the vampyre appeared in 1819, and was published by sherwood. the first issue of this, which is now very rare, contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the shelleys, byron and godwin. this was omitted in later issues, and accordingly one often finds that copies of the vampyre are described as first edition, which is strictly quite correct, although they are the second issue,

p. 290

and naturally of far less value in a bibliographer's eyes. a large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into french by henri faber, le vampire, nouvelle traduite de l'anglais de lord byron, paris, 1819. in february, 1820, there followed under the aegis of charles nodier a very obvious imitation, or rather continuation by cyprien bérard, lord ruthwen ou les vampires. ""roman de c. b. publié par l'auteur de jean sbogar et de thérèse aubert. paris, 1820."" in 1825, a new translation of polidori's story was given by eusèbe de salles. nor was germany behind hand, for the vampyre was first translated in 1819: der vampyr. eine erzahlung aus dem englischen des lord byron. nebst einer schilderung seines aufenthaltes in mytilene. leipzig, 1819. in the following year there appeared at frankfort a version by j. v. adrian of byron's poems and prose, wherein was included der blutsuger. in a collection of byron's work the first volume of which was published at zwickau in 1821, the vampyre again found a place in volume v (1821), translated by christian karl meifsner as der vampyr. the tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of byron's work even until a recent date.

yet it was well-known all the while that polidori was the author of the story, but as byron's was by far the greater name, so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of europe. writing in the same year as the great poet's death amédée pichot of the university of marseilles in his essai sur le génie et le caractère de lord byron declared that this spurious issue ""a autant contribué à faire connaître le nom de lord byron en france, que ses poëmes les plus estimés."" publishers insisted upon le vampire, ""nouvelle,"" being included among byron's works, and it is said that ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that polidori had written the vampire, the translation should properly be no longer given among the poet's work nor put forth under his name.

as might have been expected it was not long before the vampire appeared upon the stage, and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by charles

p. 291

nodier (with achille jouffroy and carmouche) which with music by alexandre piccini and scenery by ciceri, was produced in paris on 13th june, 1820, at the théâtre de la porte-saint-martin, whose directors were the popular m. m. croznier and merle. the rôle of lord rutwen was taken by m. philippe; the celebrated madame dorval was malvina; and the new play had an extraordinary success.

it was immediately published as le vampire, mélodrame en trois actes avec un prologue, par m. m. . . .; musique, de m. alexandre piccini; decors de m. ciceri. this might be purchased at 1 fr. 25cs. ""au magasin général de pièces de théâtre, chez j.-n. barba, libraire, palais royal, derrière le théâtre français, no. 51. ""the characters in the prologue are ituriel, ange de la lune, mlle. descotte; oscar, génie des mariages, m. moëssard; and un vampire, m. philippe. the scene opens in ""une grotte basaltique,"" the caledonian caves of staffa. oscar and ituriel discourse of vampires, and the latter asks: ""serait-il vrai que d'horribles fantômes viennent quelquefois, sous l'apparence des droits de l'hymen, égorger une vierge timide, et s'abreuver de son sang?"" this is indeed the case, and it is significant that on the morrow malvina (miss aubray) is to wed ""le comte de marsden."" a vision of the sleeping malvina appears when ""un spectre vêtu d'un linceuil s'échappe de la plus apparente de ces tombes"" and rushes upon her. he is swiftly repulsed by oscar, the good genius and the curtain falls. the characters in the play are: lord rutwen, m. philippe; sir aubray, m. perrin ou théringy; malvina, mad. dorval; brigitte, mad. st. amand; edgar, m. edmon; scop, m. pierson; petterson, m. dugy; lovette, mlle. j. vertpré; oscar, m. moëssard; with attendances of domestiques and villageois. the drama to a certain extent adroitly follows the lines of the polidori novel, but with notable changes, which are well contrived and introduced. lord rutwen and aubray have been fellow travellers, but the latter has no suspicion of rutwen's real nature. in fact he holds him in the dearest affection since once he was saved from death by his friend who, whilst shielding him from a brigand's attack, fell by a chance shot. when lord rutwen arrives to claim malvina's hand it is with delight aubray hails his preserver on whom he supposed killed by the bandit's gun. it is cleverly explained how

p. 292

the wound did not after all prove fatal, whereupon ""rutwen, mes desirs sont remplis"" cries aubray, ""nous allons être frères"" (ils s'embrassent). lovette a farmer's daughter of the marsden estate is to wed edgar, and rutwen graciously presents himself at the marriage feast. as lord of the manor he is received with every respect and homage, but he immediately proceeds to attempt lovette's virtue. oscar ""un viellard dont la tête vénérable inspire le respect. sa démarche a quelque chose d'imposant et de mystérieux,"" has already warned the maiden, and she coldly avoids such ardent importunities. whilst rutwen is actually pursuing the coy lass who shuns his embrace, edgar in a fury fires a pistol at the seducer and he falls crying, ""je meurs."" aubray hastening to the spot is barely in time to receive him in his arms, and with dying lips rutwen adjures him to swear the following oath. ""promets-moi que malvina ne saura point ce qui m'est arrivé; que tu ne feras rien pour venger ma mort avant que la première heure de la nuit n'ait sonné. jure-moi le secret sur ce coeur expirant."" aubray much moved cries, ""je to le jure,"" and as rutwen expires they lay the body gently on the ground. ""a`ce moment on voit la lune planer entièrement sur le corps de rutwen, et éclairer les glaçons de la montagne. la toile tombe.""

act iii. ""représente un grand vestibule gothique, la porte de la chapelle se voit au fond."" oscar solemnly utters words of warning to brigitte, who is already full of fears which are not unnoticed by malvina. when aubray meets his sister she speaks joyfully of her marriage but as he is about to tell her of the fatal happening suddenly rutwen appears and seizing his arm ""lui dit d'une voix sombre: 'songe à ton serment'!"" aubray now realizes that there is some horrid secret and displays violent emotion crying out in broken tones: ""eloigne-toi fantôme! . . ma soeur . . . dérobe-toi, aux poursuites de ce monstre . . . il te dira qu'il est ton époux . . . refuse ton serment . . . cet hymen est un crime"" at length he is carried off by the servants who fear that he has lost his senses, an idea rutwen encourages. in spite of this disorder the bridegroom now hotly presses on the nuptials; the great doors are opened ""et laisse voir la chapelle éclairée,"" rutwen and malvina approach the altar. with a wild cry aubray rushes in to intercept the ceremony,

upon which the monster drawing his dagger is about to plunge it deep into malvina's heart when one o'clock strikes,--his power is gone."" il laisse tomber son poignard et cherche & s'enfuir, des ombres sortent de la terre et l'entraînent avec elles; l'ange exterminateur paraît dans un nuage, la foudre éclate et les ombres s'engloutissent avec rutwen. pluie de feu. tableau général.""

the dialogue of this melodrama is spirited, the situations striking and well managed, and even in reading the play, one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective, especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painter's glowing perspectives, the magic craft of the subtle machinist, and the richest adornment of romantic costume. even before he had introduced the vampire on to the boards nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph, and his prediction was amply fulfilled. ""le vampire épouvantera, de son horrible amour, les songes de toutes les femmes, et bientôt sans doute, ce monstre encore exhumé prêtera son masque immobile, sa voix sépulcrale, son oeil d'un gris mort, . . . tout cet attirail de mélodrame à la melpomène des boulevards; et quel succès alors ne lui est pas réservé!"" on 1st july, 1819, writing in the drapeau blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic: ""la fable du vampire est peut-être la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . elle a partout l'autorité de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de celle de la théologie ni do celle de la, médicine. la philosophie même en a parlé.""

all paris flocked to see le vampire, and nightly the porte-saint-martin was packed to the doors. philippe and madame dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau. even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning barba's counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo, which rapidly diminished during the day.

not a few critics, however, adopted a very uncompromising attitude, and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama. in les lettres normandes, 1820, (tome xi, p. 93) le vampire was thus noticed: ""le mélodrame du vampire dans lequel on voit paraître un monstre

p. 294

qui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des tableaux qu'une honnête femme ne pout voir sans rougir, est l'ouvrage de mm. ch. nodier, rédacteur du drapeau blanc; achille jouffroy, rédacteur de la gazette et auteur des festes de l'anarchie; et carmouche autre rédacteur du drapeau blanc."" this censure is, however, wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist nodier, and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the conservateur littéraire of april, 1820 (tome ii, p. 245) where we had: ""pour balancer le succès du vampire mélodrame dégoûtant et si monstreux que les auteurs mm. ch. nodier et carmouche m'ont pas osé se faire connaître, le théâtre de la porte-saint-martin se prépare à représenter la traduction littérale, en prose, de la marie stuart de schiller.""

yet another critic is even more trenchant and severe: ""le vampire ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fiancée qui fuit devant lui sur le théâtre: cette situation est-elle morale? . . . toute la pièce représente indirectement dieu comme un être faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux génies de l'enfer.""

yet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction, and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished. in 1823 a revival of le vampire with philippe and madame dorval again thronged the porte-saint-martin to excess. alexandre dumas, who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight, how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame. how the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the vampire, how it shuddered at his stealthy steps! there are, perhaps, to be found throughout the whole of the many works of alexandre, dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of le vampire at the porte-saint-martin in 1823. it would be difficult to find a livelier, and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical, account of a theatrical performance. unfortunately it is too long to give in full. in the edition of mes mémoires, troisième série, michel lévy, paris, 1863, it occupies no less than five chapters, lxxiii-lxxvii, and these are none of the shortest, (pp. 136-193). one is tempted to quote some delicious passages, but the

p. 295

account might lose thereby; it must be read as a delightful whole. yet there is one extract which may certainly be made without impertinence, the story of the vampire which was related to dumas by his neighbour ""le monsieur poli qui lisait un elzévir."" they have discussed the tradition at some length, and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of dom calmet, from whom he gives ample citations. he further remarks that he has resided in illyria for three years, and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on nodier's melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition. ""you speak of vampires as though they really existed,"" remarks dumas. ""of course they exist,"" said his neighbour dryly. ""have you ever seen one then?"" ""most certainly i have."" ""that was whilst you were in illyria?"" ""yes.""

""et vous y avez vu des vampires?""

""vous savez que c'est la, terre claissique des vampires, l'illyrie, comme la hongrie, la servie, la pologne.

""non, je no sais pas . . . je ne sais rien. où étaient ces vampires que vous avez vus?

""a spalatro. je logeais chez un bonhomme de soixante-deux ans. il mourut. trois jours après avoir été enterré, il apparut la nuit à son fils et lui demanda à manger; son fils le servit selon des desirs; il mangea et disparut. le lendemain, le fils me raconta ce qui lui était arrivé, me disant que bien certainement son père ne reviendrait pas pour une fois, et m'invitant a me mettre, la nuit suivante, à une fenêtre pour le voir entrer et sortir. j'étais curieux de voir un vampire. je me mis à la fenêtre; mais, cette nuit-la, il ne vint pas. le fils me dit, alors, do ne pas me décourager, qu'il viendrait probablement la nuit suivante.--la nuit suivante, je me remis donc à ma fenêtre, et, en effet, vers minuit, je reconnus parfaitement le vieillard. il venait du côté de cimetière; il marchait d'un bon pas; mais son pas ne faisait aucun bruit. arrivé à la porte, il frappa,; je comptai trois coups; les coups résonnèrent secs sur le chêne, comme si l'on eut frappé avec un os, et non avec un doigt. le fils, vint ouvrir la porte, et le vieillard entra. . . .

""j'écoutais ce récit avec la plus grande attention, et je commençais à prefèrer les entr'actes au mélodrame.

""ma curiosité était trop vivement excitée, reprit men voisin,

p. 296

pour que je quittasse ma fenêtre; j'y demeurai donc. une demi-heure après, le vieillard sortit; il retournait d'où il était venu, c'est-a-dire du côté du cimetiere. a l'angle d'une muraille, il disparut. presque au même instant, ma porte s'ouvrit. je me retournai vivement, c'était son fils. it était fort pâle. 'et bien, lui dis-je, votre père est venu?--oui . . . l'avez-vous vu entrer? entrer et sortir. . . qu'a-t-il fait aujourd'hui? il m'a demandé à boire et à manger, comme l'autre jour. et il a bu et mangé? il a bu et mangé . . . mais ce n'est pas le tout. . . voici ce qui m'inquiète. . . il m'a dit . . . ah! il vous a parlé pour autre chose que pour vous demander à, boire et a manger? . . . oui, il m'a dit: 'voici deux fois que je viens manger chez toi. c'est à ton tour maintenant de venir manger chez moi.' diable! . . . je l'attends après demain à la même heure. diable! diable! eh! oui, justement, voilà ce qui me tracasse.' le surlendemain, on le trouva mort dans son lit! ce même jour, deux ou trois autres, personnes du même village qui avaient vu aussi le vieillard, et qui lui avaient parlé, tombèrent malades et moururent à leur tour. il fut donc reconnu que le vieillard était vampire. on s'informa auprès de moi; je racontai ce que favais vu et entendu. la justice se transporta au cimetière. on ouvrit les tombeaux de tous ceux qui étaient morts depuis six semaines; tous ces, cadavres étaient en décomposition. mais, quand on en vint au tombeau de kisilova,--c'était le nom du vieillard,--on le trouva les yeux ouverts, la bouche vermeille, respirant à pleins poumons, et cependant immobile, comme mort. on lui enfonça un pieu dans le coeur; il jeta un grand cri, et rendit le sang par le bouche; puis on le mit sur un bûcher, on le réduisit en cendre, et l'on jeta la cendre au vent. . . . quelque temps après, je quittai le pays de sorte que je ne pus savoir si son fils était devenu vampire comme lui.

""pourquoi serait-il devenu vampire comme lui? demandai-je.

""ah! parce que c'est l'habitude, que les personnes qui meurent du vampirisme deviennent vampires.

""en vérité, vous dites cela comme si c'était un fait avéré.

""mais c'est qu'aussi c'est un fait avéré, connu, enregistré!""

it will readily be remembered that in monte-cristo when

p. 297

during the performance of parisina at the teatro argentino, rome, the count and haidée enter their box, the countess g------ directing her opera-glass in that direction asks franz d'epinay who they may be remarking that as for herself, ""all i can say is that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up; be looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human. how ghastly pale he is!"" ""oh, he is always as colourless as you now see him,"" said franz. ""then you know him?"" almost screamed the countess. ""oh! pray do, for heaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse, or what?"" a few moments later when the lady has carefully studied the loge of their mysterious vis-à-vis, franz demands: ""well, what do you think of our mysterious neighbour?"" ""why, that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living frame,"" was the reply. this fresh allusion to byron drew a smile to franz's countenance; although he could not but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . . . . . is it possible,"" whispered franz, ""that you entertain any fear?"" ""i'll tell you,"" answered the countess. ""byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me he had seen some. the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us. oh! it is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect. the coal-black hair, large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning,-the same ghastly paleness!""

nearly thirty years after dumas in collaboration with maquet utilized the theme of le vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the ambigu-comique, 20th december, 1851, and which may conveniently be considered here.

le vampire is described as a ""drame fantastique en cinq actes, en dix tableaux"" and there are very many characters in this remarkable play. the principal parts were taken as follows: lord ruthwen, m. arnault; gilbert de tiffauges, m. goujet; juan rozo, a spanish inn-keeper, m. coquet;

p. 298

botaro, his son-in-law, m. curcy; lazare, m. laurent; lahennée, m. thierry; jarwick, m. lavergne; the ghoul, mme. lucie mabire; hélène de tiffauges, mile. jane essler; juana, mile. marie clarisse; antonia, mlle. daroux; petra, rozo's daughter, mile. heloïse; and the mystic fairy mélusine, mlle. isabelle constant. lazare is a capital character, but the intrusion from oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy. on the other hand the appearance of mélusine, whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by jean d'arras, is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history, since according to paracelsus she was an occult power, and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient houses--in belgium she is the guardian of the old family de gavre,--whilst one of her four sons became king of brittany.

it is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as dumas tells it. the play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of juan rozo's inn. they are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young botaro, and every room is occupied by his friends. and acquaintance in festive mood. juana, who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of tormenar, which lies at some little distance, for there she is to meet don luis de figuerroa, whom she will wed upon the following day. she has secretly left the convent of annunciades, where she was a boarder, since her father has other designs for her hand, and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot. but nobody, not even the good-natured lazare, the servant of the inn, will conduct her to the haunted castle, ""un château qui est en ruine, un château qui ne loge que des reptiles, et qui n'héberge que des fantômes."" however, a numerous company, amongst whom is gilbert de tiffauges, arrives at the inn, and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling, incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in tormenar, so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins, having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth, gilbert taking charge of juana who has confided to him her story. however, a mysterious figure, a lady, apparently of rank, who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take

p. 299

their departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon juana: ""il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fiancé. . . . je l'aurai joint dans trois minutes!"" she is in fact the ghoul, a female vampire, and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate don luis.

in the second act we see the huge gothic hall of the old castle. a door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming: ""il était jeune! il était beau! . . . me voilà, redevenue jeune et belle!"" the voice of gilbert is now heard, and with the cry, ""à l'an prochain, gilbert."" she disappears from sight. it will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from another's veins fresh blood, a detail which although it may recommend itself to, and legitimately be used by, the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with, and only then in folk-lore not of the first value. the travellers, no small party, spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood. the conversation, however, eventually turns on the supernatural and gilbert tells of his old home in brittany, where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the fairy mélusine, representing this lady and all her attendants. the story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune, warning him of danger should such threaten. another companion who has sojourned in epirus speaks of the vampires, the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless; the men who will attack women to drink their blood. just as the words are uttered lord ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller, who, finding no room at rozo's inn down in the village has made his way thither,-he has even taken lazare into his service. presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances. to his horror gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man, strangely pale, with a slight wound in the throat. by a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other

p. 300

than the unfortunate don luis. at the same moment a piercing cry is heard, and juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room. gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see lord ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet. in a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes ruthwen to the heart, before he recognizes who it may be. in faltering accents ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady, and with his last breath he implores gilbert, who is well-nigh distracted at the unhappy accident, to bear his body to the hillside, where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon. this gilbert promises, and in the final tableau we see the body of lord ruthwen laid upon the mountain. the moon slowly issues from the clouds, and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled. a moment more and the vampire leaps to his feet re-vitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise.

in act iii. we find ourselves in brittany, about a year later, at the château de tiffauges where hélène awaits her brother's return. after an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for antonia a lady of spalatro in dalmatia, and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the baron de marsden. this latter proves to be none other than lord ruthwen, who informs gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at tormenar, but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life. moreover, he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died, he has succeeded to the title and estates. visiting tiffauges in the hope of meeting gilbert once more, he has fallen a victim to the charms of hélène. the explanation is cleverly contrived, but at the same time gilbert is hardly convinced; he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background. a happy idea strikes him. he will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady mélusine. the scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage. gilbert is slumbering, and from their places in the tapestry step forth mélusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near. from the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride

p. 301

the old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him, mélusine reveals the secret.

""prions, pour qu' à gilbert dieu tout-puissant inspire un généreux effort.
ruthwen est un démon, ruthwen est un vampire; son amour, c'est la mort!""

(one cannot but recall the famous scene in gilbert and sullivan's ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty, fantasy and humour.)

in act iv of le vampire we are shown the accomplishment of ruthwen's designs against hélène. gilbert's frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief. they whisper that he is a lunatic, and when ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in spain which temporarily unsettled gilbert's reason, a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brother's horror and despair, the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master. ruthwen triumphs. but now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks gilbert's life for that is hers, and she will not likely relinquish her prey. ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity. lazare cautions hélène that her brother's story is no figment, but it is too late, the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes, he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins. too late gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance. there is a terrific struggle, and ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley.

in the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of ruthwen, who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance, gilbert has transported antonia to circassia. here, however, we meet the ghoul who, disguising herself under the name of ziska, obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon antonia. she informs gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire, and at that moment the ghastly face of ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window. she demands that he shall relinquish antonia's hand, and accept her love though it be to death. he refuses to betray antonia, and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the vampire may be annihilated, although this revelation must put an end to her own

p. 302

existence. ziska explains how gilbert's sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the vampire's heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest. yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh; ""adieu pour ce monde! adieu pour l'autre! adieu pour l'éternité""!

the final scene is a deserted cemetery. ""tombes, cyprès. fond sombre et fantastique; neige sur la terre; lune rouge au ciel."" the vampire lies half in and half out of his grave, grinning hideously. gilbert is standing near. ""pour la dernière fois, adore dieu!"" he adjures. ""non,"" yells the monster. ""alors, desespère et meurs""! cries gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monster's heart. the vampire falls back into the grave, howling fearfully, and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever. ""au nom du seigneur, ruthwen, je to scelle dans cette tombe pour l'éternité"", et gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse. a great aureola fills the sky and. multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen. among them are hélène and juana, smiling in happiest benison, whilst there rises from the earth the body of ziska, radiant and beautiful, to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love.

this drama of dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of nodier, but i am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work. the first two acts attain a high level; the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage; there are several other telling situations and effective speeches, but as a whole it is too prolix, and we feel that the episode of antonia in particular is an anti-climax. nor, as i have remarked before, although material use is made of the character, can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest. had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work. but without concentration and compression that was hardly possible, and here we have the secret of nodier's success. although he has an occasional crudity, it may be, which dumas might not have tolerated, so swift is his action, as is essential to

p. 303

melodrama, so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience, that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there, but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale.

immediately upon the furore created by nodier's le vampire at the porte-saint-martin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards. a contemporary critic cries: ""there is not a theatre in paris without its vampire! at the porte-saint-martin we have le vampire; at the vaudeville le vampire again; at the variétés les trois vampires ou le clair de la lune.""

jean larat further mentions a play by paul féval, le fils vampire. the version by john wilson ross of the loves of paris, a romance, published by g. vickers, 3, catherine street, strand, 1846, is said to be ""translated from the french of paul féval, author of 'the vampire,' 'the loves of the palais-royal,' 'the receipt at midnight,' 'stella,' 'the son of the devil,' etc., etc."", but it does not appear whether ""the vampire"" mentioned here is a play or a romance. probably it is the latter but no such translation is known.

le vampire which was produced at the vaudeville, 15 june, 1820, is a comédic-vaudeville in one act by scribe and mélesville. the scene is laid hungary, ""une salle d'un chateau gothique,"" and the characters are as follows: le comte de valberg, feld-maréchal, m. guillemin; adolphe de valberg, son néveu, m. isambert; le baron do lourdorff, m. fontenay; saussmann, concierge du chateau, m. hippolyte; charles, valet du comte, m. fichet; un notaire, m. justin; hermance de mansfred, madame rivière; nancy, sa soeur, madame lucie; péters, filleul de saussmann, madame minette; with attendance of domestics and wedding guests. this elegant little piece opens with nuptials of hermance de mansfred at the castle of the baron de lourdorff, to whom she is betrothed. it appears that she has something trifled with the affections of adolphe de valberg, now supposed dead. her sister, nancy, acknowledges that she loved adolphe, but kept silence owing to his courtship of hermance. adolphe's uncle, the count de valberg, who knows nothing of the two ladies, fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at temesvar, whence

p. 304

however he has disappeared. the intrigue of the seventeen scenes, although clearly unravelled in the play, is a little complicated, and it must suffice to relate by an accident adolphe appears at the castle. upon being asked his name he answers: ""lord ruthwen. an englishman,"" whereupon he is immediately taken to be a vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic. eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield; nancy's fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves, and who now realizes that hermance's heart was never his; so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding.

several pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and nancy's first song, to the air ""de sommeiller, encor ma chère from fanchon la vielleuse, is as follows:

oui, ces paysans respectables
nous rapellent le bon vieux temps:
chez eux on croit encore au diable,
aux vampires, au revenants;
on croit à toutes les magies,
aux amours, aux soins assidus,
aux grands sorciers, aux grands genies . . .
bref à tout ce qu'on ne voit plus!

les trois vampires, ou le clair de, la lune which was being played at the variétés is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by brazier, gabriel, and armand. it shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois, m. gobetout, who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house. a little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers. ""les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles!"" he groans in accents of despair. however it proves that the supper is very material, cold chicken and a glass of good wine, whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature, since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet. so the play ends with a triple marriage. one remark of the worthy m. gobetout was, it is said, nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause. he was wont to murmur in pensive accents: ""les vampires

p. 305

il nous viennent d'angleterre . . . c'est encore une gentilesse de ces messieurs . . . ils nous font de jolis cadeaux!""

another farce, encore un vampire, which when produced in 1820 at paris, met with considerable success, was published as by emile b. l., and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by a. rousseau. les etrennes d'un vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript ""trouvé au cimitière de père-lachaise.""

more amusing is the work of désaugiers who in august, 1820, gave cadet buteux, vampire, avec relation véridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet épouvantable mélodrame écrit sous la dictée de ce passeux du gros caillou, par son secretaire, désaugiers. when published by rosa, 1820, this libretto bore the motto: ""vivent les morts!""

yet another burlesque published by martinet, 1820, is le vampire, mélodrame en trois actes, paroles de pierre de la fosse de la rue des morts. a few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote, particularly as showing the long continued popularity of nodier's melodrama.

lisant pour un sou d'politique
plac' royale, sur un banc,
j'tombe, le tour est diabolique,
a' point nommé, sur l'drapeau blanc.

j'prends un billet, non pas pour le parterre,
ces places sont réservées aux amis,
sans l'secours de l'abbé saint-pierre,
avec treiz sous' j'monte au paradis.

au dernier bane, paix, qu'chacun s'taise
a' bas la gueule on crie du premier rang,
l'rideau s'lève et quoique très mal à l'aise,
le croirez-vous, j'vois le père lachaise,
du dernier bane.

the vampire is described as ""d'échappé de corbillard,"" one sees everywhere

des fantôms, des revenans,
mettant la téte a la fenêtre,
afin d'regarder les passans.

there was even a polichinel vampire which when performed at the circus maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind

p. 306

for a hearty laugh, and a contemporary visitor to paris merrily wrote that ""polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world.""

a comic operetta in one act, le vampire by martin joseph mengals which was produced at ghent, 1 march, 1826, deserves no more than passing mention.

james robinson planché speedily adapted nodier's le vampire as the vampire, or, the bride of the isles, and his version with music by joseph binns hart was brought out at the english opera house, 9th august, 1820, with t. p. cooke as ruthven, earl of marsden, the vampire. owing to his fine acting in the part, and perhaps a little to the scenic effects--the scene is laid in the caverns of staffa--the play was given nightly to packed houses. it is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented. of this i quote the following simple description: ""a vampire trap consists of two or more flaps, usually india-rubber, through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly, where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage. as with the star trap, this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide, fitting close beneath when not required, and removed when the prompter's bell gives the signal to make ready.""

the following account of the production of the vampire is given by planché in his recollections and reflections, chapter iii. having just spoken of an easter piece with which he had furnished drury lane, abudah, or, the talisman of oromanes, founded upon one of the tales of the genii and which although it had a run of nine nights planché calls a very poor piece, ""miserably put on the stage,"" he continues to speak of a subsequent success, and tells us: ""a more fortunate melodrama of mine, ""the vampire, or the bride of the isles,"" was produced at the lyceum, or english opera house, as it was then called, 9th august, 1820. mr. samuel james arnold, the proprietor and manager, had placed in my hands, for adaptation, a french melodrama, entitled ""le vampire,"" the scene of which was laid, with the usual recklessness of french dramatists, in scotland, where the superstition never existed. i vainly endeavoured to induce mr. arnold to let me change it to some place in the east of europe. he had set his heart on scotch music and dresses--

p. 307

the latter, by the way, were in stock--laughed at my scruples, assured me that the public would neither know nor care--and in those days they certainly did not--and therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it. the result was most satisfactory to the management. the situations were novel and effective; the music lively and popular; the cast strong, comprising t. p. cooke, who made a great hit in the principal character, harley, bartley, pearman, mrs. chatterley and miss love. the trap now so well known as ""the vampire trap"" was invented for this piece, and the final disappearance of the vampire caused quite a sensation. the melodrama had a long run, was often revived, and is to this day a stock piece in the country. i had an opportunity many years afterwards, however, to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself, and, as it happened, in the same theatre, under the same management; but of that anon.""

the full cast of the vampire, or, the bride of the isles was originally as follows: ""in the introductory vision""; unda, spirit of the flood, miss love; ariel, spirit of the air, miss worgman; the vampire, mr. t. p. cooke; lady margaret, mrs. chatterly. ""in the drama "": ruthven, earl of marsden, the vampire, mr. t. p. cooke; ronald, baron of the isles, mr. bartley; robert, an english attendant on the baron, mr. pearman; m'swill, the baron's henchman, mr. harley; andrew, steward to ruthven, mr. minton; father francis, mr. shaw; lady margaret, daughter of ronald, mrs. chatterly; effie, daughter of andrew, miss carew; bridget lord ronald's housekeeper, mrs. grove. with regard to the costumes of which planché speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters ruthven and lady margaret are described as follows: ruthven, silver breast plate, studded with steel buttons; plaid kilt; philibeg; flesh arms and leggings; sandals; scotch hat and feathers; sword and dagger. lady margaret, white satin dress, trimmed with plaid and silver; plaid silk sash; scotch hat and feather. this is in the true transpontine tradition of ossianic attire. the play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representation-and planché has done his work of adaptation very well, although i doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements. nevertheless he has

p. 308

given the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the french.

in 1825, t. p. cooke visited paris and appeared as le monstre at the porte-saint-martin in planché's melodrama which proved a remarkable success, running for no less than eighty nights.

the vampire or the bride of the isles has its place among the repertory of hodgson's ""juvenile drama,"" and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity.

in the second maiden's tragedy, a globe play of 1611, licensed for the stage by sir george buc on 31st october of that year, a macabre drama now generally attributed to tourneur, there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia, and a perverse ill-omened melancholy pervades the whole action. in act iv the tyrant, a usurper, ordering soldiers to attend him with ""lanthornes and a pickax"" makes his way at midnight to the cathedral, crying:

death nor the marble prison my love sleeps in
shall keep her body lockt up from mine arms.
i must not be so cozened.

a little later: ""enter the tirant agen at a farder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the toombe wher the lady lies buried; the toombe here discouered ritchly set forthe."" he adjures the sepulchre:

the house of silence and the calms of rest
after tempestuous life, i claim of thee
a mistress one of the most beauteous sleepers
that ever lay so cold.

the vault is forced, whilst the lover soliloquizes:

o the moon rises; what reflection
is thrown about the sanctified building,
e'en in a twinkling, how the monuments glisten
as if death's palaces were all massy silver
and scorned the name of marble. art thou cold?
i have no faith in't, yet i believe none.
madam; 'tis i, sweet lady, pry'thee speak
'tis thy love calls on thee; thy king, thy servant.
no! not a word, all prisoners to pale silence
i'll prove a kiss.

p. 309

first soldier:

here's chill venery!
'twould make a pandar's heels ache. i'll be sworn
all my teeth chatter in my head to see't.

tyrant:

by th' mass, thou'rt cold indeed. beshrew thee for't,
unkind to thine own blood? hard hearted lady,
what injury hast thou offered to the youth
and pleasure of thy days: refuse the court
and steal to this hard lodging, was that wisdom
.      .      .      .      since thy life has left me
i'll clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt in't,
and love the house still for the mistress' sake.
thou art mine now spite of destruction
and govianus; and i will possess thee.
i once read of a herod whose affection.
pursued a virgin's love as i did thine,
who for the hate she owed him killed herself
(as thou too rashly didst), without all pity;
yet he preserved her body dead in honey,
and kept her long after her funeral:
but i'll unlock the treasure house of art
with keys of gold and bestow all on thee
here slaves receive her humbly from our arms,
.      .      .      .      so reverently
bear her before us gently to our palace.
place you the stone again where we first found it.

after a while the scene is in the palace: ""they bringe the body in a chaire drest up in black veluet which setts out the pailenes of the handes and face, and a faire chayne of pearle crosse her brest and the crucyfex aboue it; he standes silent awhile letting the musique play, beeknyng the soldiers that bringe her in to make obeisaunce to her, and he hym self makes a lowe honour to the body and kisses the hande. a song within in voyces.

song:

o what is beauty that's so much adored
a flattring glass that cozens her beholders.
the night of death makes it look pale and horrid
the daynty preseru'd flesh how soone it molders
to loue it lyuinge it bewitchett manye
but after life is seldom heard of any.""

tyrant:

how pleasing art thou to us even in death
i love thee yet, above all women living
and shall do seven years hence. p. 310
i can see nothing to be mended in thee
but the too constant paleness of thy cheek.
i'd give the kingdom, but to purchase there
the breadth of a red rose, in natural colour,
and think it the best bargain that ever king made yet,
but fate's my hinderer,
and i must only rest content with art,
and that i'll have in spite on't.

accordingly an artist in painting and perfumery is summoned to adorn the face of the corpse and give it a fresh lively red colour. however this merchant of cosmetics is none other than govianus, the rightful heir, disguised, and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison, so that when the tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh, he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death. the incident is extremely powerful, if extremely horrible. as the tyrant expires govianus taunts him thus

o thou sacrilegious villain,
thou thief of rest, robber of monuments,
cannot the body after funeral
sleep in the grave for thee? must it be raised?
only to please the wickedness of thine eye?
does all things end with death and not thy lust?
hast thou devised a new way to damnation,
more dreadful than the soul of any sin
did ever pass yet between earth and hell?

a very large number of plays are founded upon what may be termed the ""romeo and juliet"" motive, the awakening, or the restoration to life in some sort, of a loved one supposed dead, arousing from a trance, it may be, or a coma, a theme admitting almost innumerable variants. in the italian, french and german theatres alone--nor does this rough list pretend to be exhaustive--we have sforza d' oddi's imorti vivi (1576); pagnini's imorti vivi (1600); rota's la morta viva (1674); douville's les morts vivans (1654); quinault's le fantôme amoureux (1659); boursault's le mort vivant (1662); sedaine's der tote ein freyer (1778); kurländer's der tote neffe; friedrich rambach's der scheintote; leopold huber's der scheintote; theodore friedrich's die scheintoten; f. l. w. meyer's der verstorbene; g. lebrun's die verstorbenen; tenelli's der verstorbene; holbein's ""romantisches gemälde"" der verstorbene; paers' opera die lebenden toten; and a ballet

(1803) der lebendige tote; cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum est.

it may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the vampire in the theatre, at least in his most important appearances.

an italian opera, i vampiri, the work of the much applauded neapolitian composer silvestro di palma, which was performed at the teatro san carlo in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by polidori which indeed, it preceded by nearly twenty years. but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of guiseppe davanzati: dissertazione sopra i vampiri di gioseppe davanzati patrizio fiorentino e tranese, cavaliere gerosolimitano, arcivescovo di trani, e patriarca d'alessandria. (seconda edizione.) nalopi. m.d.cc.lxxxix. presso filippo raimondi. con licenzi de' superiori.

on 28th march, 1828, at leipzig, was produced an opera, ""grosse romantische oper,"" der vampyr, founded on the original french melodrama, the scene being changed from scotland to hungary. the libretto is by wilhelm august wohlbrück and the music by his yet more famous brother-in-law heinrich august marschner. der vampyr was an enormous success. a free adaptation of this being made by j. r. planché, and produced at the lyceum, 25th august, 1829, it ran for sixty nights. in his recollections and reflections which have before been quoted, planché commences chapter x by some account of this. ""in the summer of 1829 i had the opportunity of treating the subject of 'the vampire' in accordance with my own ideas of propriety. the french melodrama had been converted into an opera for the german stage, and the music composed by marschner.

""mr. hawes, who had obtained a score of it, having induced mr. arnold to produce it at the lyceum, i was engaged to write the libretto, and consequently laid the scene of action in hungary, where the superstition exists to this day, substituted for a scotch chieftain a wallachian boyard, and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version. the opera was extremely well sung, and the costumes novel as well as correct, thanks to the kindness of dr. walsh, the traveller, who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the magyars and the wallachians.

p. 312

""i am surprised that marschner's most dramatic and melodious works, 'der vampyr,' 'die judin,' &c., have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments.

""the production of 'der vampyr' was followed by that of 'the brigand' at drury lane.""

polidori's tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts, the libretto of which was from the pen of c. m. heigel, and the music by p. von lindpaintner. this was seen at stuttgart on 2 ist september, 1828, and it proved a remarkable success. it was announced as being from ""byron's famous tale,"" although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any.

on 25th may, 1857, there was produced in berlin a ""komischen zauber-ballet morgano"" by paul taglioni with music by j. hertzel. the scene is laid in hungary during the seventeenth century, and in the sixth tableau elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle, but she is rescued by her lover, retzka, who slays the vampire morgano with a consecrated poniard. in 1861 at milan appeared a ballet by rotta, il vampiro, with music by paolo giorza. guten abend herr fischer! oder, der vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by g. belly and g. löffler, with music by w. telle, which had some success in its day. ein vampyr by ulrich franks (ulla wolf) given at vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from scribe.

in england dion boucicault's the vampire, in three acts was produced at the princess's theatre, london, 19th june, 1852, when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience. of this drama the following criticism, if criticism it may be called, was given by henry morley in his ""journal of a london playgoer."" it must be remembered that morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the ill-word of many critics to-day, for example, the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of st. john ervine in the sullens. under 19th june morley writes: ""if there be any truth in the old adage, that 'when things are at the worst they must mend,' the bettering of spectral melodrama is not distant; for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on

p. 313

monday at the princess's theatre, under the attractive title of the vampire.

""its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the lyceum into a chamber of horrors; but it has been spun out into three parts, facetiously described as 'three dramas': the little period of a century has been interposed between each part; and, in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete, the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860! by this ingenious arrangement, the resuscitation of the original vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the princess's with three acts of murder--that is, two consumated, and one attempted; but, as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case, the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates. nothing but tedious trash remains.

""to 'an honest ghost' one has no objection; but an animated corpse which goes about in christian attire, and although never known to eat, or drink, or shake hands, is allowed to sit at good men's feasts; which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young lady's blood, after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued; and which, notwithstanding its well-purchased longevity, is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeams--such a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration.

""the monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver mr. boucicault, with due paleness of visage, stealthiness of pace, and solemnity of tone; the scenery, especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of snowdon, was beautiful, and the costumes were prettily diversified; but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins. unfortunately, the mischief of such a piece, produced at a respectable theatre, does not end with the weariness of the spectators, who come to shudder and remain to yawn; for it is not only 'beside the purpose of playing,' but directly contravenes it; and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances, it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts.""

it may be pointed out that this account, probably through ignorance, possibly of intent, is deliberately inaccurate. p. 314 although confessedly a poorer play than planché's the vampire dion boucicault's drama is not derived from the earlier piece, but both are taken from the same source, polidori's romance. seeing that henry morley was emeritus professor of english literature in university college, london, it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with polidori's novella. or perhaps i rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work.

boucicault afterwards revived the vampire as the phantom, and this was given in london with good applause. the american cast of the characters of the phantom, ""as produced at wallack's theatre, new york city,"" is as follows: in act i (1645), the phantom, dion boucicault; lord albert clavering, mr. j. b. howe; sir hugh neville of graystock, mr. ralton; sir guy musgrave, mr. etynge; ralph gwynne, mr. levere; davy, mr. t. b. johnstone; lucy peveryl, miss agnes robertson; ellen, miss alleyne; maud, miss ada clare; janet, mrs. h. p. grattan. in act ii (1750), alan raby, dion boucicault; colonel raby, mr. ralton; edgar, his nephew, mr. j. b. howe; dr. rees, mr. burnett; curate, mr. paul; corporal stump, mr. peters; ada raby, miss agnes robertson; jenny, mrs. l. h. allen.

subsequently, i presume when the phantom was given in london, some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements. the first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of charles ii, and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts. this necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points; and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for act ii. in fact the script of the play which is printed in dicks' standard plays, no. 697, (c. 1887) under ""costume"" gives the following direction"": ""the costumes in the first act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of charles the second. in the second art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of wales at the middle of the present century, the following description of alan raby's costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires.

alan raby.--first act: a puritan's suit of black serge, bound with black velvet---cloak and breeches to match-black

p. 315

belt and buckle-black gauntlets---shirt collar thrown back so as to show the throat bare-black stockings-black velvet shoes with strap across the instep--black sugar-loaf hat and broad riband and steel buckle--phosphoric livid countenance--slightly bald head--long black lank hair combed behind the ears--bushy black eyebrows and heavy black moustache. 2nd dress: black dress coat and overcoat of the same colour--black trousers--black waistcoat--black kid gloves, white wristbands over them--white cravat and black german hat--all modern, and such as would be worn by a gentleman at the present time."" in the theatre such a contrast would have proved very effective.

i notice that boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from le vampire of dumas, and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the french play.

at the commencement of the phantom we are shown a room in a welsh inn, and it appears that davy and janet the hostess have just been married. a sudden storm sends lucy peveryl thither for shelter, and she confides to janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin roland peveryl, who is a fugitive and proscribed. on this account he dare not openly seek her hand, but the lovers are secretly betrothed. he has promised to meet her, in order to bid her farewell for a time, in the most unfrequented spot, the ruins of raby castle. no sooner does janet hear that name than she cries out with horror, and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place. they are interrupted by the arrival of lord clavering with a party of guests, amongst whom are friends of lucy. she frankly informs them of her rendezvous, and they decide to accompany her, more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers, who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle. davy endeavours to prevent them, nor are his efforts altogether selfish. he tells them: ""no one ever sought a night's shelter in the ruins of raby castle, that ever lived to see the morning. . . . within the ruins of raby dwells some terrible thing--man or fiend! . . . no traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall; but strange wayfarers, benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter, and the next morning they are found--dead--each with a wound in his throat in the right side, from which they

p. 316

have evidently bled to death;--but no blood is spilt around, the face is white and fixed, as if it had died of horror."" ""and he, my betrothed,"" cries lucy, ""roland is there."" nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle. this they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect, and their servants who have insisted upon davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn. roland peveryl is not to be found, but whilst they are eating a stranger enters, a puritan, and announces himself as gervase rookwood, a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains. davy, however, almost collapses with terror. he recollects that many years before the castle belonged to sir owen raby, a noble cavalier, while alan raby, his younger brother had joined the forces of cromwell. taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of puritan soldiers surprises the castle, and butchers the sleeping garrison, killing his brother with his own hand. about a year later, however, the tables are turned, the royalists recapture the place, alan raby is seized, and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice. curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered. but davy recognizes that gervase rookwood is none other than alan raby. here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some, monstrous crime, in this case rebellion against the king and the murder of a brother, is compelled to return as a vampire. when the company disperse to their various apartments for the night lord clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young roland peveryl, ""a wound deep in his throat, but bloodless."" at the same moment a piercing scream is heard and lucy peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in lord clavering's arms. seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires. when the company hurry in with lights they discover alan raby has been shot. in faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the lady's assistance. he will only forgive lord clavering on one condition. ""when i have breathed my last, let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of snowdon, and there exposed to the first rays of the rising

p. 317

moon which touch the earth."" this is done, and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of snowdon, whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light. the vampire wakes, and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones: ""fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. death! i defy thee!""

it cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with le vampire of dumas. raby castle is the castle of tormenar; lucy peveryl is juana; roland peveryl, don luis de figuerroa; lord clavering, gilbert de tiffauges; and davy the gracioso lazare.

two centuries have flown. raby castle is now inhabited in possession of colonel raby, whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin edgar. it has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle, but the scene opens with his return. when the sad news first arrived ada raby was stricken almost to death, and, as they believed, actually died; but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger, since which hour she seems to, have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power. this is none other than gervase rookwood, who now appears and informs colonel raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of raby castle. the colonel's claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old raby family, sir alan raby died, or rather was killed, and no will could be found, the estate reverted to a distant branch of the rabys, now represented by the colonel. however, a document is produced in the handwriting of alan raby, his will, wherein he bequeaths the estate to gervase rookwood and the rookwood successors. it seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted, but doctor rees, a scholar of occultism, is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger. in a ""dictionary of necromancy, a rare work by dr. dee,"" he has read of vampires, and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended rookwood. in a trancelike state ada raby has rejected edgar and is to be given to the stranger, when dr. rees examining the documents discovers that the will of sir alan raby, which must be some two hundred years old, although the hand is doubtless that of raby as the archives prove, is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850, ""scarcely five years old."" the vampire who

p. 318

endeavours to assassinate edgar, is killed by a charmed bullet. whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from ada's mind and she is united to her lover. but to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of alan raby where he has fallen, his members begin to twitch anew with life. dr. rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side, where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance.

the phantom is, of course, somewhat old-fashioned and a little stilted, as was the mode, in its diction. no doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned, yet on the whole i conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre, and some scenes, at least, in capable hands were not without emotional appeal, i had almost said a certain impressiveness. far worse dramas have (not undeservedly) earned their meed of approbation and applause.

on 15th august, 1872, was advertised: ""royal strand theatre. production of a bit of moonshine in three rays, entitled 'the vampire,' written by r. reece."" there was indeed a bounteous bill of fare. at seven was given a farce, the married bachelor; at 7.30 byron's not such a fool as he looks; ""at half past nine the new and original burlesque, a little bit of moonshine in three rays, called the vampire, written by r. reece. the new music by john fitzgerald, the new scenery painted by h. p. hall; dresses by may, mrs. richardson and assistants; machinery by wood; properties by ball. the piece produced under the direction of mrs. swanborough, mr. j. wallace, and mr. reece."" the house, says the era, 18th august, 1872, was crowded for this ""satirical burlesque."" his play, the author wrote, was founded upon ""a german legend, lord byron's story, and a boucicaultian drama."" the vampire, according to reece, is a plagiarist who lives on other people's brains. the title rôle was acted by edward terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter. ""mr. terry's make-up as the vampire was something extraordinary, and he worked with unflagging energy to add 'go' to the novelty."" during a picnic in the ruins of raby castle the vampire endeavours to steal the note books of ada raby (miss emily pitt) and lady audley moonstone (mrs. raymond) two lady novelists, so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the ""penny dreadful"" and other fiction.

p. 319

he is attacked by the two lovers of the ladies, lord albert clavering (miss bella goodall) and edgar (miss topsy venn), and a good deal of broadest farce follows. ""the author was cordially greeted upon his appearance before the curtain, and the latest strand burlesque may be noted as an undoubted success."" the illustrated london news, 24th august, 1872, although very justly doubting the propriety of the subject as a theme for travesty highly praised edward. terry ""as the hibernian plagiarist with the broadest of brogues and the most ghastly of faces."" as allan raby he haunts the ruins of raby castle, raby hall, and the peak of snowdon, seeking to filch the notebooks of tourists, ""from which he may gather materials for a three-volume novel which he has been engaged by a publisher to compose.""

on monday, 27th september, 1909, at the paragon theatre was produced the vampire, a ""two-scene sketch,"" adapted by mr. josé g. levy from the french of mme. c. le vylars and pierre souvestre. ""it is a capitally written little piece conceived. in the grand guignol vein;"" the stage, 30th september, 1909. the first scene is harry le strang's smoking-room. harry has been infatuated with a demi-mondaine named sonia, who shot herself in a fit of remorse. the despairing lover is in communication with a hindoo spiritualist seratsih, who has evoked the spirit of the dead woman, now become a vampire and preying upon harry's vitality and reason. an old friend, jack harlinger, in order as he thinks to save the situation persuades his own fiancée, olga kay, to personate the ghost of sonia. the result is swift tragedy, for the maddened harry le strang shoots her dead destroying the vampire, whilst he himself falls at the revolver of jack harlingen harry le strang was played by charles hanbury; jack harlinger, lauderdale maitland; seratsih, clinton barrett; and olga kay, janet alexander. the piece was very well received.

the vampire, a tragedy in five acts, by st. john dorset (the rev. hugo john belfour), second edition, 1821, does not appear to have been acted. it was dedicated to w. g. macready, esq., whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms. the story is oriental, the same being laid in alexandria, and it is a ""moral"" vampire that is shown by the poet. in his ""advertisement"" he quotes a passage

p. 320

from the examiner, when noticing planché's melodrama wrote: ""there are vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with, vampires of avarice, vampires of spleen, vampires of debauchery, vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny."" this is his theme, and although his pages have considerable merit i do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage, since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic,

in germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by polidori, and we have such romances as zschokke's der tote gast, spindler's der vampyr und seine braut, theodor hildebrand's der vampyr, oder die totenbraut. edwin bauer's roman à clef the clever der baron vampyr,"" which was published at leipzig in 1846, hardly concerns as here, whilst ewald august könig's sensational ein moderner vampyr, which appeared in 1883, or franz hirsch's moderne vampyr, 1873, productions which only use in their titles the word ""vampire"" to attract,--one might say, to ensnare attention, are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chap-books and pedlar's penny-ware such as morelli's der vampyr, and dr. seltzam's pornographic die vampyre der residenz.

undoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by théophile gautier in his exquisite prose poem la morte amoureuse, which first appeared in the chronique de paris on 23rd and 26th june, 1836, when the young author was not quite twenty-five. although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style, with such rich and vivid colouring, with such emotion and such repression. the darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed, yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery, even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend. the very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion. we hardly know whether romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works, or whether he is the renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance. as he himself cries: ""sometimes i thought i was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman, sometimes that i was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a

p. 321

priest. i could no longer distinguish dreams from real life; i did not know where reality began and illusion ended. the dissolute, supercilious young lord jeered at the priest, and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord."" but were he humble priest, or were he profligate patrician, one emotion remained eternally the same, his love for clarimonde. at length the abbé serapion dissolves the glamour. sternly he bids young romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where clarimonde lies buried; he exhumes the body, and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust. then also has the lord romuald gone for ever. there only remains the poor priest of god broken and alone, who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood, and who well-nigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory.

there are in english not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition, and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived; the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power, but yet it will, i think, be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of gautier. it is hardly to be disputed that the best of the english vampire stories is sheridan le fanu's carmilla, which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled in a glass darkly, 1872, carmilla which is a story of some length, containing sixteen chapters, is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to le fanu's work. the castle in styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done, nor will the arrival of carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat ""a hideous black woman, with a sort of coloured turban on her head, who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury,"" easily be forgotten.

it must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in english where the vampire element is present. e. f. benson has evoked real horror in his the boom in the tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree.

p. 322

the flowering of the strange orchid, by h. g. wells, introduces a botanical vampire. an orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the andaman islands, with a strange bulb lying near him. this is brought to england and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower. but when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts. the unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life.

this idea closely resembles fred m. white's story, the purple terror, which appeared in the strand magazine, september, 1899, vol. xviii, no. 105. here lieutenant will scarlett, an american officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of cuban territory. spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety. the blossoms which a blood-red centre exhale a strange exotic perfume. scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world, and on the following morning a native, named tito, undertakes to guide him to the spot. he learns that the natives call them ""the devil's poppies"" and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils. as night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery. to their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones, the skeletons of men, animals, and birds alike. yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley. scarlett keeps watch. in the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground. as it is about to withdraw scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife. but the man's clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops. immediately half-a-dozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey. the men are hurriedly awakened and with

p. 323

difficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers, ripping and tearing in every direction. it appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture. anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry, be it man or beast or bird. lieutenant scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by tito, who is madly jealous of their compliments to zara, the dancing-girl. they hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters.

algernon blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story the transfer. one is a human being, the psychic sponge, who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others. he is thus described by the governess: ""i watched his hard, bleak face; i noticed how thin he was, and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes. and everything he said or did announced what i may dare to call the suction of his presence."" there is also a yet more horrible monster, if one may term it so, the forbidden corner, an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden, naked and bald amid luxuriant growth. a child who knows its evil secret says: ""it's bad. it's hungry. it's dying because it can't get the food it wants. but i know what would make it feel right."" when the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself. he falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy. he lives on, but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality. as for the forbidden corner ""it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full fed and bursting thick with life.""

sir arthur conan doyle in his little story, the parasite, has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of miss penelosa, who is described as being a small frail creature, ""with a pale peaky face, an insignificant presence and retiring manner."" nevertheless she is able to obsess professor gilroy who says: ""she has a parasite soul, yes, she is a parasite; a monster parasite. she creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelk's shell."" to his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence. he resists for a while, but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield, loathing himself as he does so. when he visits her,

p. 324

with a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words. however, his victory is short indeed. she persecutes him most bitterly, and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide, which promptly goes into the gutter. with devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar, and brings about ill-natured gossip and comment. she is able to confuse his brain during his lectures, so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughing-stock of the university, until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position. almost in despair he cries: ""and the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness. here i sit in a commonplace english bow-window looking out upon a common-place english street, with its garish buses and its lounging policemen, and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place. in the home of knowledge i am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing. no magistrate would listen to me. no paper would discuss my case. no doctor would believe my symptoms. my own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement. i am out of all touch with my kind.""

the unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence, which causes him to rob a bank, violently assault a friend, and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed. at length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire, miss penelosa.

the true story of a vampire is a pathetic little story, very exquisitely told, in studies of death, by stanislaus eric, count stenbock, who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in love, sleep, and dreams; myrtle, rue, and cypress; the shadow of death; and who at least once in the other side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect. a mysterious count vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old baron wronski, and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir, gabriel. the lad wastes away, and count vardaleh is heard to murmur: ""my darling, i fain would spare thee; but thy life is my life, and i must live, i who would rather die. will god not have any mercy on me? oh, oh! life; oh, the torture of life! . . . o gabriel, my beloved! my life, yes, life--oh, my life? i am sure this is

p. 325

but a little i demand of thee. surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead."" as the boy lies wan and ill, the count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips. vardaleh rushes forth, and can never be traced again. gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace.

in a novel, the vampire, by reginald hodder, a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality. here her ravages are psychic rather than physical, albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated. a curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman, and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story. it falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes, when it constitutes a very formidable menace, but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered.

the traditional, but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by f. marion crawford in for the blood is the life. here a young man, who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return, is after her death vampirised by her, and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him. they find him upon her grave, a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat. ""and the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop."" the situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition. a hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death.

almost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale, four wooden stakes, by victor roman. the ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt, some ten miles from the small town of charing, a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls, are most vividly described. there lived the holroyds, the grandfather, the father, and three brothers. whilst in south america the grandfather ""was

p. 326

attacked while asleep by one of those huge bats. next morning he was so weak be couldn't walk. that awful thing had sucked his life blood away. he arrived here, but was sickly until his death, a few weeks later."" so says remson holroyd, who is left the sole survivor of the family, and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one. the grandfather was not buried in the usual way; but, as his will directed, his remains were interred in the vault built near the house. remson holroyd continues: ""then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died. what puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men, yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor. he was buried, or rather interred with grand-dad. the same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of george and fred. they are both lying in the vault. and now, jack, i'm going, too, for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions, yet i am as weak as a kitten."" the next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck. ""i rushed to examine it in the mirror. two tiny dots rimmed with blood--my blood--and on my neck! no longer did i chuckle at remson's fears, for it, the thing, had attacked me--as i slept."" the host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion. that night watch is kept by the friend, and as from his concealment he is gazing into remson's room he notices ""a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows. it apparently emanated from nowhere. hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light, and as i watched them fascinated, they seemed to take oil the form of a human face. the features were masculine, as was also the arrangement of the hair. then the mysterious glow disappeared."" after a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head, and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house. ""but oh, the difference in expression! the lips were drawn back in a snarl, disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth, the canines over developed and remarkably sharp. the eyes, an emerald green in colour, stared in a look of consuming hate."" the horror is revealed. the house is infested by a vampire. in the morning

p. 327

the two friends visit the vault. ""as if by mutual understanding, we both turned toward the coffin on our left. it belonged to the grandfather. we unplaced the lid, and there lay the old holroyd. he appeared to be sleeping; his face was full of colour, and he had none of the stiffness of death. the hair was matted, the moustache untrimmed, and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue. but it was his eyes that attracted me. they were greenish, and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as i had never seen before. the look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell."" they drive a stake through the living corpse, which shrieks and writhes, whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls. the head is severed from the body, and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth; and the whole corpse fell away into dust, leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones."" the remaining three bodies are treated in the same way, and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house, ten miles from the little town of charing.

although the genius of charles baudelaire, when his art required it, shrank from no extremity of physical horror, yet in his exquisite poem le vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul:

toi qui, comme un coup de couteau,
dans mon coeur plaintif est entrée;
toi qui, forte comme un troupeau
de démons, vins, folle et parée.

de mon esprit humilié
faire ton lit et ton domaine
--infâme a qui je suis lié
comme le forcat a la chaîne,

comme au jeu le joueur têtu,
comme à la bouteille l'ivrogne,
comme aux vermines la charogne,
--maudite, maudite sois-tu!

j'ai prié le glaive rapide
de conquerir ma liberté
et j'ai dit au poison perfide
de secourir ma lâcheté.

p. 328

in england there is a poem--truly of a very different kind--which appears in the life of the famous scientist, james clerk maxwell, by lewis campbell and william garnett, verses written by maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen years of age. the verses should not perhaps, because of the youth of the author, be criticized too sharply, and although they show wardour street fustian and gimcrack, since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here. it is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere, and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity. it is grandiosely entitled the vampyre: compylt into meeter by james clerk maxwell.""

thair is a knichte rydis through the wood,
and a douchty knichte is hee.
and sure bee is on a message sent,
he rydis sae hastilie.
he passit the aik, and hee passit the birk,
and bee passit monie a tre,
bot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim,
for beneath it hee did see
the boniest ladye that ever hee saw,
scho was sae schyn and fair.
and thair scho sat, beneath the saugh,
kaiming hir gowden hair.
and then the knichte--""oh ladye brichte,
what chance has broucht you here?
but sae the word, and ye schall gang
back to your kindred dear,""
then up and spok the ladye fair--
""i have nae friends or kin,
bot in a little boat i live,
amidst the waves' loud din.""
then answered thus the douchty knichte""
i'll follow you through all,
for gin ye bee in a littel boat,
the world to it seemis small."" p. 329
they goed through the wood, and through the wood,
to the end of the wood they came:
and when they came to the end of the wood
they saw the salt sea faem.
and when they saw the wee, wee boat,
that daunced on the top of the wave,
and first got in the ladye fair,
and then the knichte sae brave.
they got into the wee, wee boat
and rowed wi' a' their micht
when the knichte sae brave, he turnit about,
and lookit at the ladye bricht
he lookit at her bonnie cheik,
and bee lookit at hir twa bricht eyne,
bot hir rosie cheik growe ghaistly pale,
and schoe seymit as scho deid had been.
the fause, fause knichte growe pale with frichte.
and his hair rose up on end,
for gane-by days cam to his mynde,
and his former love he kenned.
then spake the ladye--""thou, fause knichte,
hast done to me much ill,
for didst forsake me long ago,
bot i am constant still:
for though i ligg in the woods sae cald,
at rest i canna bee
until i sucks the gude lyfe blude
of the man that gart me dee.""
hee saw hir lipps were wet wi' blude,
and hee saw hir lufolesse eyne,
and loud bee cry'd, ""get frae my syde,
thou vampyr corps encleane!""
but no, bee is in hir magic boat,
and on the wyde, wyde sea;
and the vampyr suckis his gude lyfe blude,
sho suckis him till hee dee.
so now beware, whoe'er you are,
that walkis in this lone wood:
beware of that deceitfull spright,
the ghaist that suckis the blude.

the vampire bride, a ballad by the hon. henry liddell, has considerable merit, it may be found in the wizard of the north, the vampire bride, and other poems, blackwood, edinburgh, and cadell, london, 1833. these stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ring--some say his wedding-ring--around the finger of the statue of venus whilst he is a quoiting, when he would reclaim it

p. 330

finds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn, whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse. with difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus.

in 1845 there was published at the columbian press weston-super-mare, a little book entitled the last of the vampires, by smyth upton. the chief, some critics might say the only, merit of this tale is its excessive rarity. the narrative is somewhat curiously divided into epochs, the first of which takes place in 1769, the second in 1777, the third and last in 1780. chapter i opens in an english village named frampton, but in chapter ii ""we find ourselves upon the borders of bohemia"" in the castle von oberfels. four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the first epoch. a little later we meet with the mysterious lord de montfort, and apparently he has just committed a murder, since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining montfort abbey. ""red blood, yet warm, stains their murderous hands, and is seen also in pools upon the floor; the same marks are observable, also, on their clothes."" ""the scene is a fearful one; it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold,"" and the writer wisely does not attempt the task. in the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to ""a certain young german, the baron von oberfels,"" who weds mary learmont, the elder daughter of ""sir james learmont, who being a baronet, was, moreover, a knight of the bath and m.p."" unfortunately the baron ""was one of that horrible class, the vampires! he had sold his soul to the evil one, for the enjoyment of perpetual youth; being bound, besides, to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race. every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master. mary learmont was to be the next victim; may she escape the threatened doom."" but apparently, so far as i can gather, she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told ""the baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour. her father and mother never hear of her more."" a page or two later there is ""a midnight wedding"" at the castle von oberfels. of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a ""fair presence."" ""the baron von oberfels was there, once more arrayed in the

p. 331

garments of a bridegroom."" the ceremony proceeds. the grand organ peals; the heavenly voices of white-robed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene. ""but hark! another noise is heard; sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building; the floor opens for an instant; and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the last of the vampires descended into perdition.""

i am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventy-six pages the only impression with which i am met is that mr. smyth upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes. the idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is, of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by g. w. m. reynolds in his romance the necromancer, which ran in reynolds's miscellany from saturday, 27th december, 1851, to saturday, 31st july, 1852. incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters.

the vampyre. ""by the wife of a medical man,"" 1858, is a, violent teetotal tract, of twenty-seven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction. the villain of the piece is ""the vampyre inn,"" and the dipsomaniac hero--if it be allowable to use the term in such a context--is given to ravings such as these: ""they fly--they bite--they suck my blood--i die. that hideous 'vampyre!' its eyes pierce me thro'--they are red--they are bloodshot. tear it from my pillow. i dare not lie down. it bites--i die! give me brandy--brandy--more brandy.""

a vampire of souls, by h. m. p., published in 1904, is a book of little value. the hero, george ventnor, when aged twenty, is killed in a railway accident, and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude. there is, perhaps, a good touch here and there, but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion.

it will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all, but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival to--in my opinion it is far ghostlier than--its famous successor dracula. varney the vampire, or, the feast of blood, is undoubtedly the best novel

p. 332

of thomas preskett prest, a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century. it is true that his productions published by the well-known edward lloyd, of 231, shoreditch, may be classed as simple ""shockers,"" but none the less he has considerable power in this kind, and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address. there is a certain quality in his work, which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties, that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows. to him have been ascribed, doubtless with some exaggeration, well nigh two hundred titles, but the following list comprises, i believe, his principal romances: ela, the outcast, or, the gipsy of rosemary dell; angelina, or, the mystery of s. mark's abbey, ""a tale of other days ""; the death grasp, or, a father's curse; ernnestine de lacy, or, the robbers' foundling; gallant tom, or, the perils of a sailor ashore and afloat, ""an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest ""; sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street (the most famous of prest's novels); newgate (which has some capital episodes); emily fitzormond; mary clifford; the maniac father, or, the victim of seduction; gertrude of the rock; rosalie, or, the vagrant's daughter; the miller's maid; jane brightwell; blanche, or, the mystery of the doomed house; the blighted heart, or, the priory ruins; sawney bean, the man-eater of midlothian; the skeleton clutch, or, the goblet of gore; the black monk, or, the secret of the grey turret; the miller and his men, or, the secret robbers of bohemia. to prest also has been attributed, but i conceive without foundation, susan hoply, an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by mrs. crowe, susan hopley.

varney the vampire, or, the feast of blood, was first published in 1847. it contains no less than ccxx chapters and runs to 868 pages. the many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were well-nigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance. the very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty, and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment. such a romance, for example, as newgate runs to no less than on, hundred and forty-nine chapters comprising 772 pages. the maniac father has fifty-four chapters, each of considerable

p. 333

length, which total 604 pages, and i have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume.

varney the vampire was among the most popular of prest's productions, and on account of its ""unprecedented success"" it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts. to-day the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy. indeed, it may be noted that all prest's work is excessively scarce.

it is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than brain stoker's dracula, a tale, and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation. since it was first published in 1897, that is to say one and twenty years ago, it has run into a great number of editions, and the name has veritably become a household word. it will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame. it has already been remarked that it is well-nigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length. elements which at first are almost unendurable, will lose their effect if they are continued, for the reader's mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror, and dracula is by no means briefly told. in the ordinary reprints (tenth edition, 1913) it extends to more than four hundred pages, nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity. the first part, ""jonathan harker's journal,"" which consists of four chapters is most admirably done, and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece. but that were scarcely possible. the description of the journey through transylvania is interesting to a degree, and even has passages which attain to something like charm. ""all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. it takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear."" very effective is the arrival of the english traveller at the ""vast ruined castle, from, whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose

p. 334

broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky."" very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession, those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matter-of-fact commonplace young solicitor of exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being. the continual contrasts between business conversations, the most ordinary events of the dull listless days, and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed.

so tense a strain could not be preserved, and consequently when we are abruptly transported to whitby and the rather tedious courtships of lucy westenra, who is a lay figure at best, we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate. i would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up, but it is never sustained in the same degree; and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us, fare which i have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed, yet it is difficult not to feel that one's palate, has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast. this is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling, but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect, and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winter's hearth, it would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted, which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved. but to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative, and here we return to the point which was made above.

if we review dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit. it is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters, they are labels rather than individuals. as i have said, there are passages of graphic beauty, passages of graphic horror, but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages. there are some capital incidents, for example the method by which lord p. 335 godalming and his friend obtain admittance to no. 347 piccadilly. nor does this by any means stand alone.

however, when we have--quite fairly, i hope--thus criticized dracula, the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination. accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance, the reason why, in spite of obvious faults it is read and re-read--lies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise.

it might not have seemed that dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage, but nevertheless it was dramatized by hamilton deans and produced at the wimbledon theatre on 9th march, 1925. this version was performed in london at the little theatre, 14th february, 1927. on the preceding thursday the daily mirror published a photograph of the late mr. brain stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs. ""herewith, one of the very few photographs of the late brain stoker, who, besides being sir henry irving's manager for years, was an industrious novelist. as i have already said, a dramatic version of his most famous book, 'dracula,' is to be done at the little on monday, and the scene of the grand guignol plays is appropriate, for the new piece, i hear, is so full of gruesome thrills that, in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium. truly we take our pleasures sadly.

""the dramatic adaptation is by hamilton deans, whose grandfather, colonel deans, and the rev. abraham stoker, bram's father, lived on adjoining estates in county dublin. young bram and hamilton deane's mother, then a young girl, were great friends. stoker had the book 'dracula' in his mind, and the young people used to discuss its possibilities. strange that it should be young hamilton deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to london.""

at the little theatre the cast of dracula was as follows: count dracula, raymond huntley; abraham van helsing, hamilton deane; dr. seward, stuart lomath; jonathan harker, bernard guest; quincey p. morris, frieda hearn; lord godalming, peter jackson; r. m. renfield, bernard jukes; the warden, jack howarth; the parlourmaid, hilda macleod; the housemaid, betty murgatroyd; mina harker, dora mary patrick.

p. 336

by no stretch could it be called a good play, whilst the presentation, at the best, can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate. in one or two instances the effects, upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care, were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile. ""it was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on monday night,"" said the era, 16th february, 1927. very remarkable was a lady, dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre, and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama. i can only say that i find this canard impossible to believe, quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. as an advertisement, and it can surely have been nothing else, the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste. i am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage, and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen, that it was comically intended for their entertainment. so gross a lapse of good manners, not to speak of the artistic indecorum, is hardly credible.

confessedly the play was extremely weak, and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success, and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre. on 25th july, 1927, dracula was transferred to the duke of york's; on the 29th august, following to the prince of wales, on 10th october to the garrick; and all the while it was given to thronging houses. it has also toured, and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success, the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the little, and wilfrid fletcher in particular playing the lunatic renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror. this is is extremely instructive, and it is curious that the vogue of the ""vampire play"" in london should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century. on 5th november, 1927, a new version of dracula by charles morrel was presented at the court theatre, warrington.

in america the dramatization of dracula was produced at the shubert, new haven, 19th september, 1927. this was given at the fulton, new york, upon the following 5th october.

p. 337

jonathan harker was acted by terence neil; abraham van helsing by edward van sloan; renfield by bernard jukes; and count dracula by bela lugoni .

as i have before remarked, the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can, i think, only be attributed to the fascination of the theme. consciously or unconsciously it is realized that the vampire tradition contains far more truth than the ordinary individual cares to appreciate and acknowledge. ""la fable du vampire est peut-être, la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . . elle a partout l'autorité de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de cello de la philosophic ni de celle de la médicine. la théologie même en a parlé."""

strange for me to wanna love someone
who's better by themselves
hate to know i made you crazy for myself


cause i don't want you thinking
that my love's in vain
'cause baby, i've been falling for you
but falling back up out your way


cause i can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
and i can't let you make me your, your everything
i just wanna be an escape, i just wanna be an escape
baby, can we escape, escape, escape?


admiring you from a distance
scared to go and make a move
didn't wanna be distracting
you be all up in your groove
it's strange for me to wanna love someone
who's raw all by themselves
i'd hate for you to search for someone else

they play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. they move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. they feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. they are us. this is what we have become. afraid to respect the individual. a single person within a circumstance can move one to change. to love herself. to evolve"

can we ascend to higher heights
and when the path gets rough
we can give into brighter nights breathe with peace
expound by leaps, and soul to reap, our souls to keep
the passion's deep, and filled with heat
living this life on the hustle, i barely get enough time
you know me from the platinum, how i stack them and shine
you see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world
a reputation known as the untouchable girl
i'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways
be the best that i can be to last me all of my days
now we can blaze pathways or just take our time
better holla if ya hear me cause left eye gon' shine
my eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by
you and i don't need permission to be unified
surely i done seen and heard of many places
then i travelled around the world, seen many faces
don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
and show me that nobody else can do it better than you
so if you're serious, i'm curious to see what you got
but love is furious cause i believe in blowing up spots


i'm digging you and i'm feeling you
and you know what's up
said i'm diggin' you and i'm wanting you
so tell me what's up

we need your wisdom
so that when our words flow they break down walls
in the way of unity
lord cover our children
so they live to understand
what it really means
to build with and love our fellow man
may they too find a way to pray
for peace

when the lines are drawn
and for courage
to meet our enemy
we need your wisdom
so that when our words flow
they break down walls
in the way of unity
lord cover our children
so they live to understand
what it really means
to build with and love our fellow man
may they too find a way to pray

when words escape us
just these tears for how we feel
we must insist that
there are still answers
and that what will be revealed
will heal

(yes, we will find a way)
(to pray and heal)

yes, we will find a way
to pray and heal

to erase these lines
(yes, we will find a way)
so we can be whole
(to pray and heal)
and win this fight
for the nation's soul

yes, we will find a way
to pray and heal
(yes, we will find a way)
(to pray and heal)
oh god, heal right now
free our minds
(yes, we will find a way)
to know our worth
(to pray and heal)
so we can wield power
to loose heaven on earth
i want to see you there
(yes, we will find a way)
i can't wait to see it
(to pray and heal)
'cause there is no pain
that heaven cannot heal

guess we will find a way to heal
guess we will find a way to heal
guess we will find a way to heal
guess we will find a way to heal
guess we will find a way to heal
guess we will find a way to heal"

A Long Walk|Jill Scott|r&b|"
you're here, i'm pleased, i really dig your company
your style, your smile, your peace mentality
lord, have mercy on me, i was blind, now i can see
what a king's supposed to be, baby i feel free, come on and go with me


let's take a long walk around the park after dark
find a spot for us to spark
conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
elevations, maybe we can talk about surah 31:18


your background it ain't squeaky clean shit
sometimes we all got to swim upstream
you ain't no saint, we all are sinners
but you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
i respect that, man you're so phat, and you're all that, plus supreme
then you're humble, man i'm numb with your feeling, i can feel everything that you bring


let's take a long walk around the park after dark
find a spot for us to spark
conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
elevations, maybe we can talk about revelation 3:17


or maybe we can see a movie
or maybe we can see a play on saturday
or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony
or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the roots or maybe eat some passion fruit
or maybe cry to the blues
or maybe we could just be silent
come on, come on


let's take a long walk around the park after dark
find a spot for us to spark
conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
elevations, maybe we can talk about psalms in entirety

god broke the mold
when he made this one i know
she's breathtaking but so much more
she walks in the room, your lungs close
making you never want to breathe again
her boyfriend has got so much dough
so much ice his neck and wrist froze
is he faithful to her? hell no
but she chose to be with him, shorty


tell me is the money worth your soul?
tell me what's the reason that you hold on
when you know that dude has a whole wall of 'em just like you?
and girl you're just way too fine
gotta be treated as one of a kind
girl use your mind
don't be just another dime


because
i can't take
seeing you with him
cause i know exactly what you'll be
in his gallery
just not fair
and it's tearing me apart
you're just another priceless work of art
in his gallery


she's so confused
she knows she deserves more
someone who will love and adore
but his money's hard to ignore
she really doesn't know what to do
girl it's just a matter of time
before he finds another more fine
after he's done dulling your shine
you're out the door and he's through with you






you're a masterpiece
i know that he
can't appreciate your beauty
don't let him cheapen you
he don't see you like i do
beautiful not just for show
time that someone let you know


i can't take
seeing you with him
cause i know exactly what you'll be
in his gallery
just not fair
and it's tearing me apart
you're just another priceless work of art

don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
you better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
what have you done?
you went to school that day
was a bit late but it was a monday
kept after class for answering back
you apologized, where's the harm in that


i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by


gun crime into your right ear
drugs and violence into your left
default white headphones flooding the auditory
subconscious waves you accept
you're sitting on the 4 back home
""where you at, g? answer your phone!""
pause the poison to answer his message
your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence


i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by


tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
but the face of your boy casts a darker picture
of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
""look blud i'm sorry 'cause i know you got my back
he was running, i couldn't think, i had to get out of that""
not long ago you were miming to the ""shook ones""
now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
hands you the tool as you question your friendship
how's man like you gonna make me a convict?
level of a felon when i've done nothing wrong
blood on my hands but i don't know where it's from, oh
you got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from


you better run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
better run when you hear the sirens coming
'cause they will be coming for you
run when you hear the sirens coming
better run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
the blue lights are coming for you

February 3rd|Jorja Smith|r&b|"
there's a life outside i didn't know
tied up, falling down to an empty soul
and lord knows that this love has taken toll
i've given all of my love to this broken home


so why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
what is it that your eyes don't see?
why don't you lose yourself for me?


it won't work if it don't make sense at all
i'm so lost that i can't see through the fold
the same stains that were left from the cherry wine
the same stains that i wish we could both rewind


did you notice that the feeling ain't never gone?
did you notice it's the feeling you've been running from?
you wouldn't notice if your eyes ain't falling for me?
did you open up my heart, just to take it from me?


so why don't you lose yourself for me?
so why don't you lose yourself for me?
what is it that your eyes don't see?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?


lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself, it ain't the same
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose, lose
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose, lose


when sometimes you could be lost, you could be found
i've been lost, i've been lost again and i've been found
then i found myself but i'm constantly finding myself"

and once you’re high like marijuana
you won't wanna hit no other


listen to me when i tell you
that without him, there would be no you
so yes, i thanked my ex

and sometimes it takes flowers and good wine
to show you, you don't need the late nights


listen to me when i tell you
that without him, there would be no you
so yes, i thanked my ex
a little still
cause without him, how would we know

Bleeding Love|Leona Lewis|r&b|"
closed off from love, i didn't need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
but something happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground
found something true
and everyone's looking round thinking i'm going crazy


but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i


keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open


trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from falling
but nothing's greater than the risk
that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe


but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i


keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open


and it's draining all of me
though they find it hard to believe
i'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see


but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i


keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
(ooh, you cut me open and i)
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding (oohhh)
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding (i keep...)

but life's so quick, sometimes
just blinking you might miss it when you close, your eyes

i got her, in the palm of, my hand
she knows i love her

someone like her

so many days spent apart but now
i'm finally yours (so won't you)

you know that i do not depend on
nothing or no one

so uninvited then

i be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
i think i know what this is
it's just the time's wrong
and yea i know what you did
but baby i'm grown
and my love is patient
and kind, and shit
if this is real we can build
through different types of shit
if you was really the realest
wouldn't be fightin' it
i think your pride is just


in the way
funny how everything changed
once you got all that you wanted
nothing was ever the same


and though i don't need you

South of the River|Tom Misch|r&b|"i want to stay south of the river

watching the sunshine blaze the gray

you should come south of the river
where the loving is gold

you should come south of the river
this is where it all starts
i think that we could stay here forever
lie on the roof til' it's dark

and when the last bus pulls away
i swear that i almost heard you say
""i should move south of the river.""

miss independent
ooh, the way we shine
miss independent


ooh there's something about
the kind of woman that can do for herself
i look at her and it makes me proud
there's something about her
there's something oh so sexy about
the kind of woman that don't even need my help
she said she got it, she got it, no doubt
there's something about her


cause she work like a boss, play like a boss
car and a crib, she 'bout to pay them both off
and her bills are paid on time
she's made for a boss, only a boss
anything less she's telling them to get lost
that's the girl that's on my mind


she got her own thing
that's why i love her
miss independent
won't you come and spend a little time?
she got her own thing
that's why i love her
miss independent
ooh, the way we shine
miss independent


her favorite thing to say: ""don't worry, i got it""
and everything she got: best believe she bought it
she gonna steal my heart, ain't no doubt about it
girl, you're everything i need
said you're everything i need


she got her own thing
that's why i love her
miss independent
won't you come and spend a little time?
she got her own thing
that's why i love her
miss independent
ooh, the way we shine
miss independent


miss independent
that's why i love her"

So I Can Have You Back|Joe|r&b|"
can you hear me when i pray for you
never knew tears could make an ocean blue
fear of forever is a door that i don't want closed, closed


pictures and pictures of the smile i remember
this just can't all be true


i hope he makes the biggest mistake
the unforgivable that makes your heart break
i hope you tell him ""sorry is just not enough""
and it goes from good to bad, so i can have you back


so many memories tells how long it's been
and i accept the blame as to why you're with him
he wouldn't approve of us just being friends
please, that's all i need


out of respect i back away for a while
promise to keep me in mind


i hope he makes the biggest mistake
the unforgivable that makes your heart break
i hope you tell him ""sorry is just not enough""
and it goes from good to bad, so i can have you back


there is nobody like you
(so i can have you back)
without you, i don't know what to do
the love you gave to to me
i'm using it to breathe
i know you think i'm wrong
but it keeps me holding on, to you
keeps me holding on, to you
the love you gave to to me
i'm using it to breathe
i know you think i'm wrong
but it keeps me holding on, to you
keeps me holding on, to you


i hope he makes the biggest mistake
the unforgivable that makes your heart break
i hope you tell him ""sorry is just not enough""
and it goes from good to bad, so i can have you back"
Karma|Queen Naija|r&b|"
i held you down for the longest
and i was there through all of your darkest moments
feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
gotchu some bread and start treating me bogus
talking 'bout you wanted something new (something new)
like i wasn't good enough for you (good for you)
guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
maybe you should take a look in your rear view
'cause obviously you forgot all the times that i held you when you cried
and don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong i stood by your side?
no i guess not, i guess not, 'cause you let them thots take my spot
congratulations to you, what you wanted is what you got now (you got now babe)


so you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)
you made it clear that you're unhappy (unhappy, yeah)
go ahead and have your fun now (fun now)
just remember what goes around, comes around
you don't gotta worry 'bout me (don't gotta worry, baby)
you made it clear that you're unhappy (you're unhappy, yeah)
go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)
just remember what goes around, comes around


i remember when you said that you could have somebody better
and i can't even lie to you it really messed my head up
had me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself
wishin' that i looked like someone else
like the girls you liked on instagram (damn)
and you really had the nerve to call me insecure
maybe it wasn't you
maybe it's true i didn't know my worth (didn't know my worth)
maybe, maybe i should've loved me first (loved me first)
maybe, maybe i should've loved me first


so you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)
you made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)
go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)
just remember what goes around, comes around
you don't gotta worry 'bout me (you don't gotta worry, no)
you made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)
go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now, yeah)
just remember what goes around, comes around (come around)


around, around, (yeah) around
what goes around it comes around, ay
around, around, (yeah) around
what goes around it comes around, yeah
around, around, (yeah) around
ooh"

Breathe Again|Toni Braxton|r&b|"
if i never feel you in my arms again
if i never feel your tender kiss again
if i never hear i love you now and then
will i never make love to you once again
please understand if love ends
then i promise you, i promise you
that, that i shall never breathe again
breathe again
breathe again
that i shall never breathe again
breathe again


and i can't stop thinking about
about the way things used to be
and i can't stop thinking about
about the love that you make to me
and i can't get you outta my head
how in the world will i begin
to let you walk right out my life
and blow my heart away
and i can't stop caring about
about the apple of my eye
and i can't stop doing without
without the center of my life
and i can't get you outta my head
and i know i can't pretend
that i won't die if you decide
you won't see me again


if i never feel you in my arms again
if i never feel your tender kiss again
if i never hear i love you now and then
will i never make love to you once again
please understand if love ends
then i promise you, i promise you
that, that i shall never breathe again
breathe again
breathe again
that i shall never breathe again
breathe again


and i can't stop thinking about
about the way my life would be
no i can't stop thinking about
how could your love be leavin' me
and i can't get you outta my mind
god knows how hard i tried
and if you walk right out my life
god knows i'd surely die
and i can't stop doing without
without the rhythm of my heart
no i can't stop doing without
for i would surely fall apart
and i can't get you outta my mind
cause i know i can't deny it
and i would die if you decide
you won't see me again


if i never feel you in my arms again
if i never feel your tender kiss again
if i never hear i love you now and then
will i never make love to you once again
please understand if love ends
then i promise you, i promise you
that, that i shall never breathe again
breathe again
breathe again
that i shall never breathe again
breathe again"

so how bout we spend some time
turn off this broken record girl

'til someone falls outta love
nothing's ever enough
still they try and play
it's a crying shame

just to move and rewind
and crash anyway… anyway

Fill Me In|Craig David|r&b|"
i got something to say, something to say
alright (can you feel me?)
come on
can you fill me in?
what you want? what you want me to do, baby?
can you fill me in?
let's talk about it


i was checking this girl next door when her parents went out
she phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
so i knock at the door
you was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
so i went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
so we jumped right in
all calls diverted to answer phone
please leave a message after the tone
i mean me and her parents were kind of cool
but they were the fine line between me and you
we were just doing things young people in love do
parents tryna find out what we were up to


saying, ""why were you creeping 'round late last night?
why did i see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
now you're dressed in black
when i left, you were dressed in white
can you fill me in?""
calls diverted to answer phone
red wine bottle, half the contents gone
midnight return, jacuzzi turned on
can you fill me in? (it's another one, it's another one)


whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
i'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
so she knocked at the door
i was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
the club we went in
we got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
saw it was early morning
thought we'd better be leavin'
so i gave you my jacket for you to hold
told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
i mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
i weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
we were just doing things young people in love do
parents tryna find out what we were up to


saying, ""why can't you keep your promises no more?
say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
out went the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
can you fill me in?
wearing a jacket, who's property
said you'd been queuing for a taxi
but you left all your money on the tv (can you tell me?)
can you fill me in? (can you fill me in?)""


all they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
watchin' our every move
think some day they might approve, baby


""why were you creeping 'round late last night?
why did i see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
now you're dressed in black
when i left, you were dressed in white
can you fill me in? (can you fill me in?)""
calls diverted to answer phone

checking how my hair and nails look

when i hear my favorite song
should i send a email at home

baby, i'm helpless
look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit i’m
helpless, baby
down for the count, and i’m drownin’ in ‘em


i ain't ever been the type to try and grab the spotlight
we were at the revel with some rebels on a hot night
laughin’ at my sister as she dazzling the room
then you walked in and my heart said 
tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
everybody’s dancin’ and the bass top volume
grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
saying to myself, ""baby, this one’s mine.”


shorty made her way across the room to you
and i got nervous, thinking “what’s she gonna do?”
she grabbed you by the arm, i’m thinkin’ “i’m through”
then you look back at me and suddenly i’m


helpless, yeah
look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit i’m
helpless, baby
down for the count, and i’m drownin’ in ‘em


helpless, yeah
look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit i’m
helpless, baby
down for the count, and i’m drownin’ in ‘em


one week later, i’m writin’ a letter nightly
now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
laughin’ at this girl, cuz she wants to form a harem
...no, i ain't sharin'
two weeks later, in the living room stressin’
my father’s stone-faced while you’re asking for his blessin’
i’m dying inside, as you wine and dine
and i’m tryin’ not to cry
‘cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do


my father makes his way across the room to you
i panic for a second, thinking “we’re through”
but then he shakes your hand and says “be true”
and you turn back to me, smiling, and i’m


helpless, yeah
look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit i’m
helpless, baby
down for the count, and i’m drownin’ in ‘em
helpless, yeah
look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit i’m
helpless, (so helpless) baby
down for the count, and i’m drownin’ in ‘em


ashanti, i ain't got a dollar to my name
an acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
all i have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain
a couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
insane, your family brings out a different side of me
peggy confides in me, angelica tried to take a bite of me
no stress, my love for you is never in doubt
we’ll get a little place in queens and we’ll figure it out
i’ve been livin’ without my family since i was a child
my father died, my mama cried, i grew up buck wild
but i’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
and long as i’m alive, ashanti, swear to god
you’ll never feel so… (baby i'm)


helpless, yeah
look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit i’m
helpless, baby
down for the count, and i’m drownin’ in ‘em


helpless, yeah (i'm so helpless)
look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit i’m

helpless, baby
down for the count, and i’m drownin’ in ‘em

a lonely mother gazing out of the window
staring at a son that she just can't touch
if at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
but all the praying just ain't helping at all
cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
so he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
another body laying cold in the gutter
listen to me


don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast


little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
but he just can't see
she gives him loving that his body can't handle
but all he can say is, ""baby it's good to me""
one day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
but he doesn't recognize his own face
his health is fading and he doesn't know why
three letters took him to his final resting place
y'all, don't hear me

come on!
i seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one god-given ray
is it because my life is ten shades of gray, i pray
all ten fade away, seldom praise him for the sunny days
and like his promise is true, only my faith can undo
the many chances i blew to bring my life to anew
clear and blue and unconditional skies
have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
my only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
with such an endurin pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin rain
who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein
what a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
you claim the insane, and name this day in time
for falling prey to crime
i say the system's got you victim to your own mind
dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you


don't go chasing waterfalls

Piece Of Mind|Kehlani|r&b|"
to be honest, i think we spend so much time
trying to find answers for things
and maybe it's just not meant to be answered
i think sometimes the best things
are in the unplanned and the unknown
and sometimes when we balance back and we do it
we don't know how we did it, we just do it
it's something in us, whether that's our intuition
whether that's the way we been raised
whether that's down to even what we put in our bodies
do you get it? so i think—i think that can remain a mystery
and i think that's okay for it to remain a mystery
does that make sense?


tryna forget all of the messages
tryna forget all of the stressin'
'cause damn it was (extra and—)
tryna forget all of the secondary
feelings i had, man, it was fuckin' scary
tryna get back to all my old ways
tryna get back to all the hobbies
from my old days (gettin' back)
tryna forget all the unnecessary
thoughts from my head, man, it was pretty scary


at least i learned a thing or two about me and you
what we went through, it made me who i am (i am, i am)
i can feel again, won't be numb again (numb)
at least i didn't mess it up, that was all your touch
i don't miss it much, but it made me who i am (i am, i am)
i can feel again, won't be dumb again (dumb)


said i'm tryna break off a piece of mind
a piece of mind that i can't get right
(can't get it right)
said i'm tryna break off a piece of mind
a piece of mind, my heart's on my side
(heart is on my side)


you said yourself, you made me who i am
you told me that after you, i would never love again (didn't i?)
oh you made sure that i would lose myself
so i wouldn’t see, i needed no one else
you tell me that i was worth a million smiles
and tell me that i was worth a million miles
and tryna make sure that i forget the times that
you made me think that i just couldn't shine, yeah


at least i learned a thing or two about me and  you
what we went through, it made me who i am (i am, i am)
i can feel again, won't be numb again (numb)
at least i didn't mess it up, that was all your touch
i don't miss it much but it made me who i am (i am, i am)
i can feel again, won't be dumb again (dumb)

on my side, yeah
on my side, yeah
gotta get a little piece of mind
gotta make sure that it feels just right
gotta make sure that i’ll make it last this time

every day i wake up, i hope i'm dreamin'
i can't believe this shit
can't believe you ain't here
sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
it's hard to just keep goin'
it's like i feel empty inside without you bein' here
i would do anything man, to bring you back
i'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
i saw your son today, he look just like you
you was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
i miss you b.i.g

i can't wait til that day, when i see your face again
yeah, this right here, tell me why
goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
that they truly loved, c'mon, check it out


seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
i laced the track, you locked the flow
so far from hangin' on the block for dough
notorious, they got to know that
life ain't always what it seem to be
words can't express what you mean to me
even though you're gone, we still a team
through your family, i'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
in the future, can't wait to see
if you open up the gates for me
reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
try to black it out, but it plays again
when it's real, feelings hard to conceal
can't imagine all the pain i feel
give anythin' to hear half your breath (half your breath)
i know you still livin' your life, after death


every step i take, every move i make
every single day, every time i pray
i'll be missing you
thinkin' of the day, when you went away
what a life to take, what a bond to break
i'll be missin' you


it's kinda hard with you not around
know you in heaven smilin' down
watchin' us while we pray for you
every day we pray for you
til' the day we meet again
in my heart is where i'll keep you, friend
memories give me the strength i need to proceed
strength i need to believe
my thoughts big i just can't define
wish i could turn back the hands of time
us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
you and me takin' flicks
makin' hits, stages they receive you on
still can't believe you're gone
give anything to hear half your breath
i know you still livin' you're life, after death


every step i take, every move i make
every single day, every time i pray
i'll be missing you
thinkin' of the day, when you went away
what a life to take, what a bond to break
i'll be missin' you


somebody tell me why
on that morning
when this life is over
i know
i'll see your face


every night i pray, every step i take
every move i make, every single day
every night i pray, every step i take
 every day that passes
every move i make, every single day
 is a day that i get closer
 to seeing you again

every move i make, every single day

it's a feeling that i want to stay

I Don't Wanna Be Without You|The James Hunter Six|r&b|"
why’d you pick san francisco to shoot your special?


this is one of the best towns that ever knew comedy and this is the most historic venue you got as far as comedians are concerned because lenny bruce ripped it down here. yeah, all the best came through the bay. what about richard? what about robin williams? carlin? mooney? you don’t necessarily have to be the biggest star. as long as you come with it then people coming out, they like to see live performances, because it’s a savvy audience.


san francisco, are you ready! i don’t think he can hear you. are you ready! welcome to the show. here’s dave chappelle! woooooooo!


oh, man. oh, shit, oh, shit. yes, bring it on, bring it, man. yes, thank you. thank you, all. thank you for coming. goddamn. i did it big this year. from cable, nigga, goddamn. thanks for coming out, and thanks for making a nigga feel comfortable... in ""the gayest place on earth."" you guys got disney world jealous about this, motherfuckers! man, i didn’t really think it was that gay at first. because i thought, ""what is there about it?"" because when i was coming out here everyone was like, ""man, that place is really gay.""

so what the fuck is everybody talking about? it’s not so gay. and then i wandered into that castro. goddamn, it was – i said, “this is america’s anus right here. this shit is deep.” i went to that tenderloin. ...there’s nothing tender about that motherfucker at all, that shit was rough; the opposite of tender. i have never seen crack smoked so casually before. these niggas were sitting in front of starbucks, smoking crack and drinking coffee. i said, ""this is off the hook..."" talking about politics.

i’ve seen one crack-head trying to break into somebody’s car, man, and it struck a chord with me. i tried to stop it. i said, “hey!” and he looked back and saw me and said, “keep an eye out.” i said, “nigga, that was me that said that! i’m not trying to ""help"" you. i want this shit to stop!”

crack-heads are like that. i had a crack-head break my car window one time. broke it! you know what he stole? fucking candy bar i had lying on the seat. that’s all he took. just a goddamn candy bar. i was so mad; i drove around the neighborhood for five hours looking for a crack-head with chocolate on his face. i did that. i finally found him, i grabbed that motherfucker. i said, “hey, man, what’s all this chocolate on your face, motherfucker?” he looked confused. ""chocolate? this is doo-doo, baby.” i said, ""ahh!"" oh, man. this place is insane.

but you know what i like about san fran and the reason i picked this city to do my special is because of all the major cities in america, somehow people get along here better than anywhere else i’ve seen in the country. that’s right. that’s right. and i always admire san fran for that. and today, i’ve realized how you did it.

put all the niggas on the ""other side"" of that bridge.

there’s nothing – this shit ain’t happy on that side. if you leave san francisco, they’re like, “bye, thanks for coming to san francisco. come back in april, we’re having a sale on birkenstocks.” as soon as you get to the other side, “welcome to oakland, bitch.” click. click. it’s fucking crazy.

but it also feels like it’s an east coast city in the west coast. you guys got subways and shit. i’m scared of public transportation.

i was on a bus that was held hostage, 45 minutes.

it wasn’t life-threatening. i don’t want to give you that impression. it was a dude jerking off, but the shit was scary, son, it was scary.

because right before it happened, i was on the bus smoking a cigarette. it’s a long story. it’s not the coolest shit i ever did, and people freaked out. –

“sir! sir, put that goddamn cigarette out, okay?” this is everybody’s air, sir.”

– i flicked it. i didn’t want any trouble.

and just at that moment, coincidentally, this homeless dude, out of nowhere pulls his dick out, started beating off. and i was furious... because nobody's saying shit to this guy! they were just looking like, “my god.” i was the only one on the bus that had the balls to say anything to him. it’s not even like i was brave really, it was that... you know... i was sitting next to the motherfucker. i had to say something. –

""come on, dog, you’re hitting my elbow. stop. son, just stop.""

– it’s all i said. i was – i didn’t want to say too much. guy’s beating off on the bus means there’s something wrong with this motherfucker. he’s not wrapped so tight and i didn’t want to push him over the edge.

soon as i said something, all these dummies on the bus, now they’re brave. –

“oh, he’s right. put your goddamn cock away. i don’t want to see this anymore.”
“i don’t want to see it either.”
“yeah!”

– now, the guy flips out. –

“all right, everybody, back up! back. the fuck. up! i tried to be nice about this!”

– now, everybody freaks out. “oh, my god, it’s a biological attack, oh...” i’m caught in the middle. i can’t lose my cool. i said, –

“hey, everybody, just calm the fuck down or you’re going to get me shot!” “let’s all just be cool.” “let’s do what this man says, so he’ll leave us alone.”

– now everybody gets quiet. –

“that’s better. that is better...”

– and then he started walking up and down the aisles, just terrorizing us. and then he starts making demands. –

“you in the pink shirt, squeeze your tits together.” “oh, god, no, no...”

""you! stick your finger in your butt.”
“why? oh, god, why is this happening? oh, god, oh god.”

– he was working my way. this shit was tight. just that minute, i got saved, dudes! i was so lucky. this guy, at the other end of the bus, he snapped. he lost his mind. i'd seen it happen. he screamed out, “rush him! he can’t cum on all of us!"" and he charged down the aisle. and it’s like a movie -- this homeless dude’s seen him coming. he shot one off. –

“ahhh!"" *poof*

– i dodged that shit like the matrix, nigga -- ohhh.
...the guy behind me wasn’t so lucky, though. –

“no, noooo!” *thump*

– that shit was gross.

it didn’t kill him, but it was – i’m sure that fucked his day up.

you’re not going to have a normal day if a homeless dude busts a nut on your forehead at 8:30 in the morning. that’s a wrap on the rest of the day. this guy was freaking out. –

“it burns! ahhh, ahh, ahh!!”

– everyone was standing around looking at him. even the homeless dude felt bad. i guess he was finished; he came back to his senses. –

""oh, this is my stop.”

– i said,–

“relax, motherfucker.”

– i had to say something.–

“relax.”
“oh, i can’t. i got aids, i know it.”

– i said, –

“you can’t get aids from a homeless dude busting a nut on your forehead. that’s not how it spreads!”

– ...i don’t even *know* if that shit's true. that’s just what i told him, man! he was so scared, i had to say something.

i don’t know where aids comes from. who the fuck knows? scientists don’t even know. scientists still say aids started because somebody had sex with a monkey. word? after all these researches, the best explanation that you came up with – nobody fucks monkeys and people, you idiot!
you either ""fuck monkeys"", or you ""fuck people."" that’s it. there’s no... in-between.

...you’re not going to get monkey pussy on tuesday and then be like, “well, let me call charlene,” on thursday. no! once you've fucked a monkey, that’s a firm decision. i’m out of the human pussy game, for good. it’s ridiculous!

they act like monkeys are just as open as waiting for people to fuck them, man. monkeys don’t want to be fucked by people! think about it. think about *how hard* it would be... to catch a monkey... and fuck it. that’s ridiculous. that’s how it had to go down. do you think you’re just going to walk up to him, in the woods, and bribe this nigga with fruits and bananas? –

“hey, buddy, hey.”
(mimes offering the food)
“yeah, there you go, buddy... yeaahhh.”
(mimes petting followed by bottom-groping)
“there you goooo, with your big, bright red ass.”
(mimes unzipping his pants)
(whisper)
“this big bright red bootyyyy.”

– do you know how *strong* a monkey is? it would rip your dick off, like a celery stalk. ""grrr."" throw that shit in the tall grass, to never be seen again? –

“...hey, dog, we’re going to go to the club, pick up some girls, you trying to roll?”

“no, man, i’m cool. i’m going to stay home, dog, chill with my monkey. ...you know how long it took me to train this monkey to suck my dick without peeling it? mmm! last night, chimp-chimp jerked me off with his feet, nigga. only a 'monkey' can show you that kind of love and tenderness. so you all keep fucking these people if you want, niggas. it's more monkey pussy for meee! ...i’m hooking up with an 'orangutang' next week.  that's all i fuck, is chimps and orangutaaaangs.”


– you know who i feel real bad for, is indians. everybody feels bad for the indians. they get dogged openly, because everybody thinks they’re *dead.* these motherfuckers are not all dead, alright?! i’ve seen, with my own eyes, i’ve seen a gathering of 1,500 native americans. they were all gathered in one place.

the place is called wal-mart in new mexico.

there was indians everwhere. i’d never seen indians before! i wasn’t even sure if they were indians... it was fucked up, but i *asked* one of them. it’s not nice, but... i seen them in the sports section, looking at bows and arrows; i had to say something. –

“excuse me, i don’t mean to be rude, um... are you an indian?”

and he was cool.

“yes. yes, i am indian.”

– i still didn’t believe him. i had to test him and be sure. this is fucked up. but i had a gum wrapper in my pocket. so, i balled that shit up and i threw it on the floor. and... a single tear came out his eye! i said, “oh, shit! i have so many questions.""

i said, “what tribe are you from?”

“i am a navajo.”

i said, “word? i studied you in social studies. you’re a hunter-gatherer, correct?”

he said, “i guess so, if that’s what you wish to call it.”

i said, “why, what do you call it?”

he said, “i am... an alcoholic.”

i said, “well, what’s your name, dawg?”

he said, “please, dog is my cousin. that’s a good guess. my name is running coyote. what is your name, friend?”

and that shit caught me off guard. i didn’t want to say my name was *dave* to a motherfucker named running coyote. it just don’t feel good enough. he’s putting me on the spot.

i said, “huh, my name? what?! oh, my name’s black feet.”

then i changed the subject, “forget about me. what’s going on with you? i want to meet your chief. why don’t me, you, and your chief, and your friends get together tonight? we could have a real-life peace pipe-smoking ritual; we need to celebrate nigga, 'cause i thought you were dead.”

and he set it up! it was beautiful. oh, it was just like i dreamed... we was all sitting around. the indians was beating the drum.

(tribal drum beat)

some other indians came out the back with a long blanket that was folded in half and put in front of us.

(tribal drum beat)

opened that shit up, and on the blanket was a long wooden pipe with feathers... and bags of weed were *all over* the blanket. the chief walked over.

(tribal drum beat)

""the big ones are 50. the little ones are 25 and these are 10.”

maaaan, those indians got high as shit. i was baked. i told the chief! he was talking, i cut him off.

“time out, chief. sorry to interrupt. i’m fucking *smashed*, man. the weed is... too strong! you *sure* this isn’t pcp?! the spirits have got me! chief, the spirits have got me!” and the chief threw some water in my face.

“calm down, blackface.” splash.

i said, “hey, it’s black *feet*, motherfucker. take it easy!”

“black feet, you are welcome to stay amongst me and my tribe for the night, *until* the spirits leave you.”

and they gave me my own teepee to sleep in, which *sounds* nice. i personally felt like i was 'a little' fucked up. you know, because they all had *houses*, man. it’s like, why can’t i sleep with you all in the house and watch tv? like, i can’t be on this grass all night. the indians is rude, man.

everybody’s rude, the indians, they’re eating nasty food, all they ate was corn and shit.

doritos, i think they called it.

that’s right.. people only see the surface. they see the division in our 'foods.' just because i eat ""chicken and watermelon..."" they think there’s something wrong with me. let me tell you something, if you don’t like chicken or watermelon something is wrong with you motherfucker, there’s something wrong with you. *where* are all these 'people' that don’t like chicken and watermelon? i’m sick of hearing about how bad it is. it’s great. i’m waiting for chicken to approach me to do a commercial, nigga.

""i’ll do it for free, chicken! it’s the *least* i can do.""

they make fun of latin people for eating – what you all eat? beans? rice? corn? listen, that’s *not* a reason to hate a motherfucker, all right? it’s funny, but it’s *not* a reason to hate.

the only reason these things are even an *issue* is because... nobody 'knows' what ""white people"" eat. you’ve been *very* good at keeping that shit a secret, amongst yourselves. i study white people. you don’t know that. i’m writing a *paper* on you. not even for school, nigga. just to do it, just to – i’m just doing this as independent research. i’m spending my money. that’s why i’m working so hard. i follow you around grocery stores. they freak out. i just try to peek in their cart.

they always say, “get away from my cart, nigger! what’re you *looking* at? ...chicken and giblets are over there! you *must* be lost. these are vegetables.”

...i know what you drink. (snaps) see how quiet it got?

grape juice.

surprise, motherfuckers! you didn’t know i knew about grape juice, did you? oh! don’t play dumb with me. like, ""ah, what is it?""

a lot of black people don’t have the privilege of knowing about grape juice because they... have *grape drink*. it’s not the same *formula* that you get. ain’t no *vitamins* in that shit.

you might have one of your black friends over, “todd? todd, would you care for a glass of grape juice?”

“what?! nigga, what *the fuck* is 'juice?!' i want some *grape drink*, baby. mmm.. it’s *purple.*

""i don’t think i know what a grape drink is.”

“whaaat?”

“i have some apple juice if you want.”

“what the fuck is juice?! i want some *apple* drink! it’s greeeeeen.”

remember that commercial for sunny delight? when all the kids run in from outside playing and they all run to the fridge?

“all right, i got some purple stuff, some sunny d.”

as soon as they say “sunny d,” all the kids go, “yeah!” watch the black kid in the back. if you ever see that commercial, look at that black kid.

he’d be like, “i want that purple stuff.” that’s drink, nigga, it’s drink. they want drink. they don’t want all them *vitamins*, man. they want drink. sugar, water, purple!

that’s the ingredients: sugar, water... and of course, *purple.*

it’s too fucking much.

...i got a lot of things to talk about tonight! first of all, i’ve stopped smoking weed. ...with *black* people; you didn’t let me finish, motherfuckers. goddamn.

i’m sorry, black people, to break the news so publicly, but i *can’t* smoke with you anymore.

*every* time i smoke weed with my black friends, all you talk about is your 'trials' and 'tribulations.' i’m sick of that shit. i got my own problems. nigga, that's a *waste* of weed. i’m smoking weed to run away from my problems, not take on yours.

from now on, i smoke weed *exclusively* with white people.

calm down, motherfuckers, you win by default.

you got good *weed* conversation. all 'white people' talk about when they get *high,* is other times that they got high. i could listen to that shit all night.

“dude, remember at frank’s last week? i was fucking smashed, man.”

and catalogs everything they drink.

“i had two shots of jäger, tequila... four bong hits, man. beer; cheeseburger...” that shit is great.

the only bad part is... you cannot pass out around white people. every time white dudes pass out around each other they always do some... borderline-gay shit when the guys are asleep.

“frank fell asleep so we, like, stuck a carrot in his ass... and put shaving cream on his balls...”

why, motherfucker? why’d you do that to a friend of yours? he trusted you to sleep around you and you’re going to put a carrot in his ass? is that – is that nice?

i’ll tell you right now, if i put a carrot in a black dude’s ass, that nigga will kill you when he wakes up for some shit like that. that is an automatic... death sentence on the street. it’s a wrap for you.

“i’m gonna kill that motherfucker.”
“i thought y'all was friends, baby? what happened?”
“i fell asleep at his house, right? i was drinking and i fell asleep at his house and while i was sleeping, right? ...i’m just going to kill that motherfucker, all right, that’s all you need to know... and fuck carrots.”

but everybody’s getting along. i see that shit. i see it all around, blacks and whites don’t fight so much.

you know who don’t have no beef with anybody is asian people. i see how ya’ll been doing. you all just lay in the cut. i’ll tell you, the only people asian people beef with is other asian people. like if you call a korean guy chinese; i’ve done this, they’ll flip out.

“hey! what makes you think i’m chinese? i am korean! do i *look* chinese?”

""yes, motherfucker, you *do* look chinese. that’s why i said it. it’s an accident, nigga. to the untrained eye, you *all* look chinese to me.""

it’s a mistake. i’m not trying to offend you. *some* people say all black people look alike. we don’t get bent out of shape. we normally just call those people 'police,' okay?! just learn to live with it. that’s all i can tell you.

everybody’s afraid of the police now. i’m scared to death of these police. i am. i got a police scanner. first money i got, that’s the first shit i went out and bought; new police scanner. i just listen to these motherfuckers before i go out. just to make sure everything’s cool. you hear shit on it.

“calling all cars, calling all cars. be on the lookout for a black male between 4’7’’ and 6’8”.

staying in the crib tonight! fuuuuck that. got to work on that *alibi* for a minute.

every black person needs an alibi. i do them impromptu joints. if i’m by myself and need an alibi, i just open up the windows in the apartment; turn the lights on; start beating off right in the window.

“look at me, hey, everybody, look, it’s me, dave chappelle. crazy. i’m jerking off – note the time, motherfuckers, it’s 2:35; look at me, i’m jerking off in the window, 2:35. comedian dave chappelle, it’s june 10th, note the tiiiiiime.”

that shit could save my life.

“officer, dave chappelle *couldn’t* have done that. i saw him in his window masturbating, from 2:35 to 2:37, i’m certain of it. he was standing on a clock and holding a calendar and today’s paper.”

fuck, i need an alibi. i can’t be no celebrity. this shit is just the worst. i’m seeing it.

i can see why – i see why stars are crazy, man, these motherfuckers... i went to disney world with my kids, which is a 'big deal' for me. i don’t get to see my kids so much. i do ""chappelle’s show"" 20 hours a day. sleep for, like, half an hour. raise my kids for 10, 20 minutes and then i go back to work. now this *particular* day i got to hook up with the kids. we went to disney world. everybody at the park, fucking everybody! --

“hey, heeeey! ...i’m rick james, bitch! hey, i’m rick james, biiiiitch.”

it was like, “hey, man, hey, you mind not calling me a bitch in front of my kids? time out, motherfucker, we take a day off."" even mickey mouse did it. i said, ""this is the most un-professional shit i have ever seen in my life.""

“i'm rick james, bitch. huh-hah.”

oh, i was fed up. i caught that motherfucker with an uppercut – paaa. knocked his head clean off. everybody was screaming.

“oh, my god, oh, my god! ...mickey mouse is mexican.”

i had a terrible time in disney world. disney world’s like a whole 'nother country anyway. they got their own currency. that shit's ridiculous. soon as i check in the hotels --

“welcome to disney world, mr. chappelle. can we interest you in some disney dollars?”
“no, man, i’m cool. can’t buy weed and pussy with disney dollars, nigga. i’m on vacation.”

i like them greenbacks. i like them greenbacks, you know what i’m saying? the kind of money people spend. people are very particular about that.

i saw that... there was one  of the main stories from the war was... the first big thing we did was they said, “now that iraq has been liberated, we have managed to take saddam hussein’s face off of the money.” and i’m not going to lie, when that press conference came on, i was like choked up. i was actually *proud* to be an american because that is a very subtle psychological nuance of oppression to have a dictator on your money, and it’s *thoughtful* to be able to take that motherfucker off for the goodwill of *another* person, right?!

but then i thought, ""well, if you could do that for iraq, what about our money, man? our money looks like baseball cards with slave owners on them.""

george washington’s the worst of the worst.
...yes, i said it. we mythologize this motherfucker like he was 'the greatest dude', man.

if i went back in time with a white person and we saw george washington walking in front of our time machine, my white friend would probably be like --

“oh! my god, dave, look, there’s george washington. he’s the father of this great nation. i’m going to go shake his hand.”

-- i’d be on the other side like --

“run, nigga! george washington!!”

-- and we'd both be right. you like him because he wrote the declaration of independence and all that shit.

“we hold these truths to be self-evident. all men are created equal... go get me a sandwich, nigger, or i’ll kill you! ...liberty, justice for all.”

am i wrong? am i wrong? wait a minute, did he not own slaves, didn’t he own slaves? that’s all i’m saying.

i almost protested the war in the beginning. almost. 'till i saw what happened to them dixie chicks. i said, “fuuuuck that!” if they’ll do that to three *white* women, they will *tear* my black ass to pieces. i don’t want to hear that shit. yeah, man, they would. but i’m, like, for real, why? why do you care so much what the dixie chicks are saying? it’s not like they’re political scientists. they just bitches that can sing good. you know what i mean? stop worshipping celebrities so much. just don’t listen, don’t pay attention.

i remember right around september 11, ja r.u.l.e. was on mtv. that’s what they said. “we got ja r.u.l.e on the phone. let’s see what ja’s thoughts are on this tragedy.” who gives a fuck what ja r.u.l.e thinks at a time like this? this is ridiculous. i don’t want to dance, i’m scared to death! i want some answers that ja r.u.l.e *might not* have right now. you think when bad shit happens to me, i’ll be in the crib like --

“oh! my god, this is terrible! could somebody please... find ja r.u.l.e, get hold of this motherfucker, so i can make sense of all this? where is jaaa? help me, ja rule....”

-- i don’t even know why people listen to me. i’ll say anything, nigga. i’ve done commercials for coke and pepsi; i don’t give a fuck what comes out of my mouth. i can say what it takes, whatever it takes, that’s what i’m sayin'.

if you want to know the truth, can’t even taste the difference. surprise!

all i know is, pepsi paid me most recently, so... it *tastes* better.

that’s pretty much how the game goes. i’m just being real, man. there’s too much goo-gaa over celebrities. people don’t know what’s fake and what’s real anymore. that’s why bill cosby got in trouble.

look what happened to bill cosby.

bill cosby said some real shit, and the whole world freaked out on him. for what? for having an opinion? just because he was selling pudding pops for the last 40 years; people forget that he’s a nigga from philly -- and the projects -- and he might say some real shit from time to time. it’s not that big of a deal.

i spoke at my old high school and i told them kids’ straight up –

""if you guys are serious about making it out of this ghetto, you've got to focus, you've got to stop blaming white people for your problems, and you gotta learn... how to rap or play basketball or something, nigga! you’re trapped! you. are. trapped. either do that or sell crack. that’s your only options. that’s the only way i’ve ever seen it work.

you got to entertain these white people, nigga. get to dancin'!! go on out there, and be somebody.""

– i just hope they listened.

this shit is ridiculous. people worship television. they worship this shit. you know, like, if you watch a movie, right, say you’re watching a movie and one character says to another character, let’s say –

“hey, what’s your number, man?”

– what does the other character always say? –

“555-5555.”

–  you know why they got to do that? because stupid-ass people go to the movies and then go home and try to call the characters that they just saw. –

“hello, is indiana jones there?”

– no, motherfucker, he’s fake. it’s not his number.

to be honest, this is the worst time in history to be a black celebrity. fuck. they’re locking up all our stars up. it’s hot right now for black celebrities. i knew it was bad when kobe got in trouble. i said, ""this is a wrap for us."" he’s one of the most wholesome dudes we’ve had! and they lock him up and everything.

and kobe kept it together. thank god he held his game together, because if he was cracking under pressure and getting like, six points a game the whole of l.a. would be like, –

“that nigger is guiltyyyy.”

–  kobe was playing his ass off. he was playing like his freedom depended on that shit. you see this motherfucker in them games this nigga’s trying to beat that case on the court.

like the judge threw him the ball, like, –

“play for your freedom.”

–  if i could talk to kobe, i’d say be –

“just relax, you’ll be fine, man.”

– because the public is still giving kobe the benefit of the doubt. he’s one of the few black celebrities that get that.

not cause he’s a celebrity, more because... the girl showed up with eight different semens to the investigation. you can’t do that. that’s *seven too many.* that’s a lot of semen, man.

this bitch’s got noah’s ark in her panties.
what’s she trying, to recreate humanity or something?! she’s a collector!

she got every unsolved mystery; the answer might be in this girl’s panties. that’s the first place i’d look. oj’s other glove is in there. bigfoot’s footprint. three csi reruns is in that motherfucker.

she’s got the most diabolical drawers ever.

fuck being a celebrity. this is not the time to be a black star. they’re locking all our stars up! black celebrities. it’s a witch hunt for us, man. goddamn it.

it’s all oj’s fault.

ever since oj got away, white people just been locking up our stars, one by one. it’s true. and it’s all – it’s not even oj’s fault, it’s our fault. we celebrated *too openly* when oj got acquitted. we should’ve been quiet about that shit. soon as there’s, “not guilty,” niggas start dancin'. –

""oh, in your face! in your face. it hurts, don’t it? it hurts. burns, doesn’t it? oh, that justice system burns, doesn’t it? welcome to my world, motherfucker...""

-- and all *that* shit. white people wanted oj’s ass bad. the city of l.a. spent over $12 million just *trying* that motherfucker; and the *look* on white people’s face when he was *acquitted?!*

priceless.

priceless – and that’s why i don’t trip over being a celebrity. i don’t like it. i don’t trust it.

because one minute they all love you; the next thing you know... you’re in front of a *courthouse* dancing *on top of a car* just trying to figure out what the *fuck* happened to you.

that’s what i’m waiting for... because the *timing* of this michael jackson shit is what makes me doubt it. *every* time there’s wars going out of control, or the economy is bad or something is wrong with the world at large, it’s always *these moments* in history that michael jackson will, coincidentally, jerk off a kid. this is getting ridiculous. are you planning this shit? do you have *meetings?* –

“michael, thank you for coming. as you know michael, the war has not been going as well as we expected. there’s been a lot of hiccups, and the public is asking us a lot of questions of course and well, michael, there’s no nice way to say this and all i know how to do is be direct, so let me just be direct.

we’re going to need you to jerk off another child, mike. i’m sorry. i am sorry. but it would really help out.”

–  or, maybe he did it. who knows? who knows?! that’s the thing, that’s what i wanted to say, who knows? who the fuck knows?

mike, god, and this little boy know. that’s about it. that’s about it.

the only reason that i can even talk about this shit is because... everybody is *speculating.* they all think he did it. and i dont think he did it. i’m alone in this. i don’t think he did it.

...i’m not gonna say i don’t *think* he did it. that’s too... *strong.*

let me just say i am ""reserving judgment..."" until *all the facts* come out.

so far from what i heard, i mean, the kid said he’s dying of cancer, he was in make-a-wish foundation. he claims he had two weeks to live and it was his dying wish to meet michael jackson.

come on, man, give me a fucking break.
this kid is 10 years old. he don’t remember thriller! what the fuck he want to meet michael jackson for? honestly.

i remember thriller and i just, like, *kinda* wanna to meet this nigga. i wouldn’t break an appointment to meet him; i’ll put it that way. i’d have to already be free. that’s ridiculous. because, like, if i’m dying in two weeks and go –

“oh! mama, get me in a room with chubby checker.”

– i wouldn’t want to meet that motherfucker, not in my last two weeks! why not usher or somebody like this?

so then the kid claims he goes to michael’s house; this is where it all gets crazy... i don’t...like, you know. ...he does *everything* that you’d expect at michael’s house.

they climbed trees and rode roller coasters and ferris wheels. the chef made cookies, pies, and cakes. they was *petting a monkey* and giraffes, singing songs. kid shit.

and in *the middle* of all this *childlike activity,* for some reason... mike put out some *wine* and some *pills...* and sucked this kid’s dick.

folks, it hurts me to say it.

...and the kid had the nerve to call that ""abuse."" motherfucker, that is a good host, goddamn. what else do you want? what more do you want?!

i’m lucky to get a glass of *grape drink* at my friend’s house; *let alone* a roller coaster ride and my dick sucked. mike must be *confused* like --

""i brought you in my house, i fed you, i sucked your dick, and *this* is how you repay me, motherfucker? this was your wish, not mine. ...i thought you were dying in *two weeks*. what happened to that, motherfucker? i’ve been in court for a year-and-a-half. you get stronger every time i see you.""

-- wouldn’t it? this is fucked up, though... i shouldn’t even say this, this is fucked up, but....

wouldn’t it be some ironic shit if they found out, through this case, that... the ""cure for cancer"" was michael jackson sucking your dick, somehow?

like if mike had powers like ""green mile"" and all the kids are like--

“please, mike, suck our dicks!”

“mm-mmm. never again. you didn’t appreciate it, really.”

“can we at least study your saliva?”

“nuh-uh. uh, huh.”

“please, mike.”

-- it doesn’t stop, though. it just doesn’t stop. and the only reason i can talk about mike is because... he is a *freak.* he is a freak. that’s why people let you talk about him.

because if i brought up catholic priests fucking kids, it’d get quiet as shit. (room falls silent)

...but when *michael jackson* does it, it’s okay, because he’s a freak. his face is all... *cut up.* and just remember, when you look at that *thing* that he calls *his face,* that he did that for you somehow. somehow he thought you might – maybe it’ll help. --

“maybe people will like me more if i turn myself into a *white...* ghoulish-like creature.""

-- i don’t know what the fuck it is, but he did it for you. and i appreciate the gesture, michael jackson. if you’re watching this, i appreciate that gesture and i want you to know, fuck everybody. dave chappelle understands. because you want to know something? i'm getting some work done. surprise! yes. nothing major. you would never know if i didn’t tell you, but it’s some shit i’m insecure about that i want to work on.

if you must know... i’m getting botox done on my balls to get these wrinkles out. finally to have these just as smooth as eggs!  and ohhhh, i can't wait. i cannot wait.

and i’m not stopping there. that’s just phase one, baby. i’d be like bob vila, ""these old balls."" i’m fixing them up!

i’m plucking all the hair out. i got to make room, i know there is, i got to make room. i’m going to tattoo a gangster-ass face on with mean expressions, like this. then i’ll grow the hair back on the bottom, so they got beards like me.

then i’m hitting that beach and looking for ball-suckers. i’m going to wear some high shorts, just like this. and walk up to women with a confidence i’ve never had before. –

“pardon me, miss, i don’t mean to be rude, but do you suck balls?”

“excuse me?!”

“miss, relax, you didn’t even let me finish. do you suck... *theeeeese* balls?”

“...ohhh-myyyy-god, those balls are as *smooth* as *eggs.* ...yes, i’ll suck them.”

–  i’ve played this scenario out in my mind a million times, lady, that’s how it always ends –

“yes, i’ll suck those balls.”

– all our stars, all our stars, man.

r. kelly *pissed* on his victim.

i know it was rough, but i mean, again, i can’t even judge r. kelly. first of all, we don’t know if these allegations are true or not. even if they *are* true, if you want to know how i feel about it, honestly... if a man cannot *pee* on his fans... i don't wanna be in show business anymore. because, well, that’s why i got in *the game,* baby. i got dreams, too.

you guys are *confusing* the issue.

while you guys are busy worrying about if r. kelly even peed on this girl or not, you’re not asking yourself the *real* question that america needs to decide once and for all. and that question is, –

“how old is 15, 'really'?”

– no, that’s a good question! that’s a good question. i’m not saying that a person is as smart as they’re going to be at 15. that’s not what i’m saying, man.

but i am saying... 'fifteen' to me is old enough to decide whether or not you want to be pissed on.

i mean, that’s me.

if you can’t make a decision like that by the time you’re 15, then just give up, motherfucker, because *life* is waaaaaaay harder than that. i make tougher decisions all the time. if you don’t want to get pissed on, just get the fuck  out of the way; it’s not even a decision!

if i start peeing on the front row they won’t have to calculate and think –

“how do i feel about this? am i okay with it?”

–  they just move. you can do that at 15. i could have.

i’ve been 15. when i was 15, i was doing stand-up in nightclubs. i smoked reefer from time to time. my friends were selling crack. i was trying to finger-fuck people. i *knew* what was happening around me to some degree. getting pissed on was the least of my worries at 15; trust me. but it keeps coming up.

there’s a lot of confusion around that age. any time 15 comes up, people freak out, like when that girl elizabeth smart got kidnapped, right?

remember in utah last year, a 15-year-old girl, elizabeth smart was kidnapped, and then they finally found her and the whole country was... ""relieved.""

and i was the only one saying, –

“damn, she wasn’t that *smart* after all.”

– not because she got kidnapped! that could happen to anybody. i’m not knocking her for that. i’m *just saying*, if you kidnapped me when i was 15... you gotta take me *further* than eight miles away from my house, man. goddamn. you can’t hold me prisoner around shit i recognize!. i’ll break away! i’ll break away.  –

""fuck off, nigga! that’s my *bus stop.* i know where i’m at. i’m going home!""

– she was missing for six months, 8 miles away from her house. that’s *two exits*, man. that’s nothing!

...and while she was missing, during this half a year that this girl was missing, there’s a 7-year-old *black girl* gets kidnapped in philadelphia. nobody knows her name. they might’ve talked about it two or three times on the news, but *she* should’ve been the top story. because she chewed through the ropes and had *both* of these motherfuckers in jail in 45 minutes flat. seven year old. i’m not making this up!

these two crackheads kidnapped her, took her to the crackhouse and tied her up. and then they left her! they’re crackheads, they got to make moves; crack to smoke, chocolate to eat. those motherfuckers made moves, they was out. as soon as they left, this little girl got to nibbling. she’s kidnapped at 4:00 and at home watching herself on the news at 5:30. that shit is crazy. that’s a news story. that is a news story.

now, ""meanwhile in utah...."" fifteen-year-old elizabeth smart’s captors left her alone, too. and they didn’t even tie her up cause they’re hillbillies. they just bounced.  –

“don’t try to escape, bitch, or we’ll kill you. be right back.”

– and they leave. and she’s fifteen, sitting in the house *by herself*. –

“how am i going to get *out* of this? come on, elizabeth, *think.* think, elizabeth, how am i going to get out of here...?”

– why don’t you just *open* the fucking door and *go outside*? have you *thought* about that? do you have a quarter? do you know your phone number?! you’re 15, bitch, run! stop thinking and *start making moves.*

i know i sound mean. and i know what the people are thinking when i’m saying this, –

“dave, she’s only 15.”

– alright, but that’s the discrepancy, because when you talk about a ""little girl"" like elizabeth smart then the country feels like 15 is ""so young and so innocent.""

on the flip side, *here comes* 'fifteen' again. *now* we’re talking about a 15-year-old *black* kid in florida. this black kid accidentally killed his neighbor when he was practicing wrestling moves that he saw on tv.

now, was he a 'kid?' no! they gave him life. they always try *our* 15-year-olds as adults. –

“this nigger knew what he was doing. he’s a *goddamn* pile driver. ...this kid gets on the ropes, there’s no stopping him. we’d have to send the rock to arrest him.”

and they gave a 15-year-old boy life in jail.

...if you *think* that it’s *okay* to give him life in jail, it *should be legal* to pee on him.

that’s all i’m saying. you've got to make up your mind *across the board* how old 15 actually is. that’s all i’m saying.

because i’m going to tell you right now, if somebody comes in here and puts a gun to my head and says, –

“chappelle, you've got a choice to make! you’re either going to jail for a month or we’ll let you go... but you gotta let r. kelly pee on you.”

– i’m not hesitating. –

“bring in r. kelly, and tell him to *stay away* from my eyes.”

–  i’d rather get pissed on, on the outside than fucked in the butt on the inside. i can’t go to jail with some smooth botox balls and think everything’s going to be *alright.* it’s not that kind of place. take my chances with that piss.

piss will wash off with a 10-minute shower. i’m certain of it. –

""this piss is coming *right out!* ...what could i do? they were going to put me in jail.""


– society is changing rapidly.

you can’t smoke indoors. what *the fuck* is that all about? i got kicked out of a titty bar for smoking. no, that shit was ridiculous. the *stripper* did it! the stripper came up like, –

“your smoking is a health risk for me. i don’t want to work in this kind of environment.”

""bitch, you had your gonorrhea-infested pussy in my face. *you* started it!""

– and they threw me out! it’s the dirtiest place i’ve ever been thrown out of. ...and just to give you an idea of what i mean by ""dirty,"" lap dances at this place? three dollars.

it’s fucking disgusting.

and at the same time... *who* could pass up a sale, son? it was $3 dollars!! of course, i did it. it’s only 12 quarters. said, –

“i’ll break a five for that.”

– i’ve never seen somebody work this hard for $3 dollars. this lady must’ve been a throwback to the great depression. she was all over me. it’s the first time i ever told a stripper to get off me. –

“alriiiight. yeah, *thank you* very much, miss. thank youuuu! that’ll be all. .....that’s enough, thanks! hey! heeeey, get off of me! ...whatever happened to *lipstick* on the collar, lady?!  ...i have a shit streak on the middle of my shirt!""

– how the *fuck* am i going to explain this when i get home? –

“huh? oh, no, baby, me and bob were playing basketball and bob dunked on me. he was hanging on the rim, and his pants fell down? i was checking up close, i think he was swinging and his butt cheeks might’ve... his butt cheeks, i think, caught my shirt. ...i don’t know *why* i was playing ball in my dress shirt? i don’t know. it was midnight. i don’t know... what the *fuck*?! ...just let me think.""

that’s when you know a guy was lying when he says shit like that. –

“hold on, just let me think.”

– your man ever said that to you? –

“hold on, just let me think for a minute. can i... can i think?!”

– y'all women... you guys just make  much progress too fast. not too much, but you’re just confused. you made so much progress you're even confused. men and women, we both like, –

""what the fuck just happened?""

– because women got all this money now, but they’re *still* like women. –

“oh, you never take me anywhere anymore.”

and you’d be thinking,–

“bitch, you got more money than me, you never take me anywhere anymore.”

and at the same time, you don’t treat a man like a man. you don’t cook, you don’t clean, and you don’t do anything a motherfucker says. you tell the motherfucker what to do. i see women do this to men all the time. –

“come on!”

– no man wants that shit. i don’t want anybody to tell me what to do that much. you got to work with me.

like if it makes a man ""feel like a man"" to watch the game, and just let him sit down and watch the game for a minute. and if he happens to look over at you while watching the game don’t look at him all mean and make him feel guilty about watching it.

just *pick up* your own titty and suck it. just try it out! he will instantly remember why he fell in love. –

“ohhh, that’s right! i forgot my girl sucks her own titties from time to time. i can’t walk away from that. it’s too hard to find.”

– you see? that took 20 seconds. you still can be just as busy as you want; just suck your own titty and everything’s cool. or how about this? if you’re making love to your man, you already make love might as well spice it up, right?

how about this: i *personally* like it... i like it when a girl tells me *where* to cum. don’t like it when she tells me *when* to cum. i hate that shit. –

“don’t cum yet.”
""oh, bitch, all these rules!""

– instead of doing that, why don’t you just tell us *where*? it would make us feel better. especially, if you’re aggressive about it. i like it when a girl gets wild with me.  –

“cum in my face!”

– stick your chin out like a boxer. –

“bring it on, motherfucker. you’re a bum!”

but it doesn’t have to be that wild or explicit.
all a man wants to know is if you’re interested and if you will participate. you can say anything, he’ll be happy. –

“oh, oh, cum on top of the television.”
""alright, fuck it!""

– the weirder the place, the better. –

“cum in my fishbowl.”
""damn, fishbowl. ...oh, shit! they’re eatin' it! ohh!.”

– fish love it when i come over. –

“it’s that guy! we’re having chicken tonight.”


you guys, man, thanks. this has been the best year of my career by far.

i appreciate you guys watching me because i do it for my kids, really. and my kids are off the hook. you think i’m a bad motherfucker, wait till you see the 2000 model chappelle. this nigga is *off* the hook. my sons are bad.

my oldest son is three. this nigga made me a necklace out of macaroni. i said, –

“this shit is baller!”

he painted the macaroni green and put it on a string. he tied it on my neck and he told me he was proud of me, and i got choked up. and he thought i was sad. that’s how smart he was. he says, –

“are you sad, daddy?”

– and i said,–

“no, i’m not sad. you’re too young to understand this, son, but this is *fucking crazy.* ...you used to live *in my balls*, man. now you’re making jewelry out of macaroni? you’re a bad motherfucker.”

long live chappelles.

oh, shit. thanks, guys. thank you. that’s what it’s all about.

everybody usually wants to be famous so they can rock nice jewelry and all that shit. i already got a macaroni necklace. i got valuable shit. i got – i got valuable shit. i’m not in it for that.

the only kind of shit i want to do with fame that’s decadent is i want to go to vegas to the $5,000 blackjack table...and i don’t even want to play. i just want to be such a big star that i can go up to one of the players in a tight hand... and put my dick on his shoulder.

and i’m *such* a celebrity, they think it’s funny. -

“hey, what the fuck?! oh, shit, dave chappelle! wow.”

- he gets on his cell phone -

“you are not going to *believe* whose dick is on my shoulder right now! ....and this guy’s balls are as smooth as eggs!!! he’s had some *work* done.”


- couldn’t thank you enough. god bless you all, man.

keep watching, man. i’m going to try to make it interesting. stay safe. (i’m rich bitch!)"

and concentrate on things that bring you healing""
while i know that you're trying to help
you should be trying to save yourself

been thinking bout it
how ""us"" applies to you

One, Two Step|Ciara|r&b|"with lyrics from “one, two step” by ciara and missy elliot

baby phat coat a feather-stuffed
fist around my shoulders, i shuffle
onto the playground ready to
fight. i’ve clawed months of mornings
out of my mother’s calendar to reach
today: my official tryout for the cool
black girls of 4th grade.
legend has it their gossip turns
to gloss on they lips. legend has it they can
suspend you with a look. the glitter-clique
has a simple audition: memorize missy and ciara’s slick
anthem for us and spit it like i got beef
with the devil himself. my first
lesson in what ferocity means to girls
with our sunset skin. i wouldn’t call it courage,
what nudges my hand-me-down nikes
anxious across the blacktop. instead, i name it
what we name the wolf’s instinct to bind to its pack.
this beat is automatic.
who can call us prey
when we fang like this?
side-eyes so box-cutter sharp
no white boy has talked to saniyah in months.
supersonic, hypnotic everybody at recess know
she lying about having a knife. but there are some truths
you don’t let off the leash. like how our mothers send us
to school without popping the bubblegum
dream that any of this will protect us.
that there isn’t a world of things that want us
dead that we can’t even pronounce yet. but i’m here,
in the midst of this black girl blood recital,
hoping to make the cut for safety. deja don’t
think i got what it takes. asks why i don’t have
the mandatory crush on usher. and all i can think
of is the way her eyes catch the light. here i was
thinking this club, this little swingset secret, was for black girls
that love black girls for life. that wanted to hold
a hand just as soft as theirs and know every good
shade of forever. i tell deja i would follow her lip gloss
anywhere if she’d let me. but there are certain truths
you don’t let off the leash. deja suck her teeth.
tells me her mom said princesses don't
marry each other and i become the swingset beneath her.
hold her every afternoon until she decides
she’s outgrown that kind of freedom.
it don't take long for my chances
of friendship to rust in the rain between us.
when i tell this story, i always say
i pushed her off the swings."
Hey Ya!|OutKast|r&b|"
1, 2, 3, uh!


my baby don't mess around
because she loves me so, and this i know for sure (uh)
but does she really wanna
but can't stand to see me walk out the door? (ah)
don't try to fight the feeling
'cause the thought alone is killing me right now (uh)
thank god for mom and dad
for sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (c'mon)


hey ya! hey ya!
hey ya! hey ya!
hey ya! hey ya!

you think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
but “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
we get together, oh, we get together
but separate's always better when there's feelings involved
if what they say is “nothing is forever”
then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
so why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?

Lean Into It|Joe|r&b|"twelve weeks we been in this thing
what’s stoppin’ us both from movin’ full steam ahead
i know we both want the best
let go, it’s not that hard
lookin’ for a reason to fail before we start
don’t let it tear us apart
maybe we can get a little reckless
take some chances ’til we perfect this
all we gotta do is…


lean, lean into it
give me all that you got now
and baby i’ll, i’ll give you all of me
just lean, lean into it
we won’t fall, we won’t shut it down
don’t shut it down
even if you don’t believe, just lean

we brought some baggage in with both of us
with this baggage, ain’t no room to trust
if we gon’ win, we gotta go in
believe me, that’s the only way
let’s do like we already know
never had a love like this before
put your heart into it
your “all” into it

maybe we can get a little reckless
take some chances ’til we perfect this
all we gotta do is…


let’s take some chances
change our circumstances
we’ll find true love, finally"

hit you where it hurt

yeah, i tried to play it cool, 'cause we're never really stable
it's never ever able to figure out

while you keep me on the side line
i'm sick of all this trying, trying, trying
while i watch you drift further away, yeah


it's like i have you but i don't really have you
but i'm giving you all of me, when i only get half of you
sometimes i'm way too understanding and i give too many chances
i keep making up excuses while you make-off like a bandit
but now, it's getting harder to ignore
settled for so little, but i want so much more from you, my dear
you've got to make things clear


keep waiting for the right time

told me you'd love me so i'd know it's real
you know i try, try to believe in us
try to believe in us, but it gets hard as fuck, you know it

and tripping on ice
sharing advice, taking it twice

fly away and counting days

handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
held back, i had to grab crab legs
and then there were only but a few
conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view
what a dress, what a song
what a beautiful time
my folks downstairs still waitin' in line
they never been in these rooms
never stayed with these folks
never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
so as i fly in my suit, in a group, undercover
forcin' a new smile, he tells me another
he said ""what happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?""
then he pushed me off the top and said ""jump, nigga, jump!""


oh don’t bring me down i need a room up in the clouds
i wanna get there babe, i wanna elevate
oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss
in the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

Confessions Part II|Usher|r&b|"
watch this


these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions
man, i'm throwed and i don't know what to do
i guess i gotta give part two of my confessions
if i'm gonna tell it, then i gotta tell it all
damn near cried when i got that phone call
i'm so throwed, i don't know what to do
but to give you part two of my confessions


now, this gon' be the hardest thing i think i ever had to do
got me talking to myself, asking how i'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part one i told y'all i was creeping with, creeping with
said she's three months pregnant and she's keeping it
the first thing that came to mind was you
second thing was how do i know if it's mine and is it true
third thing was me wishing that i never did what i did
how i ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship


these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions
man, i'm throwed and i don't know what to do
i guess i gotta give part two of my confessions
if i'm gonna tell it, then i gotta tell it all
damn near cried when i got that phone call
i'm so throwed, i don't know what to do
but to give you part two of my confessions


sitting here, stuck on stupid, trying to figure out
when, what, and how i'ma let this come out of my mouth
said it ain't gon' be easy
but i need to stop thinking, contemplating
be a man and get it over with, over with
i'm riding in my whip, racing to her place
talking to myself, preparing to tell her to her face
she open up the door and didn't want to come near me
i said ""one second, baby, please hear me""


these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions
man, i'm throwed and i don't know what to do

if i'm gonna tell it, then i gotta tell it all
damn near cried when i got that phone call
i'm so throwed, i don't know what to do
but to give you part two of my confessions


this by far is the hardest thing i think i've ever had to do
to tell you, the woman i love
that i'm having a baby by a woman that i barely even know
i hope you can accept the fact that i'm man enough to tell you this
and hopefully you'll give me another chance
this ain't about my career
this ain't about my life
it's about us
please


these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way

boy, this evening, was it only me
feeling completely down to be open
down to be open for some satisfaction
didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
i knew it was wrong for feeling this way
especially the thought of getting in on the first date
couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
at the end of the night, i had to decide
i was thinking


i should make a move but i won't (i should, i should)
i know you're probably thinking something is wrong
knowing if i do that it won't be right
i don't get down on the first night
i should make a move but i won't
i know you're probably thinking something is wrong
knowing if i do that it won't be right
i wanna get down, but not the first night


we were chillin, watching your tv
i thought you were coming close as you got to me
wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
and somehow in one night, discover i love you
felt so right but it felt so wrong
and look how we are carrying on
try to say things to get me to stay
but my watch tells me it's getting too late
i'm thinking

i should make a move but i won't
i know you're probably thinking something is wrong
knowing if i do that it won't be right
i don't get down on the first night

i should make a move but i won't
i know you're probably thinking something is wrong
knowing if i do that it won't be right
i don't get down on the first night

you got to know me
and if you want my love
you gotta win my love

hey baby
that's the way it's got to be, yeah
get to know me, get to know me
so we can do this

i should make a move but i won't
i know you're probably thinking something is wrong
knowing if i do that it won't be right
i wanna get down, but not the first night

i should make a move but i won't
i know you're probably thinking something is wrong

One Wish|Ray J|r&b|"can i talk to you for a minute?

you know, i be thinking to myself
we had a lot of good times together (come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
we did everything together

yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (all i need, all i need, all i need is a chance to make it right)
and just get in the car and just ride on out (just one chance)
remember that? (all i need, all i need, is just one wish)
use to watch the sunrise
(one wish, one wish)

use to watch the sunset (all i need, all i need, all i need is a chance to make it right)
we was everything to each other, you know? (just one chance)
(all i need, all i need, is just one wish)
damn, i miss those days
(one wish, one wish, one wish)

(all i need, all i need, all i need is a chance to make it right)
if i could, if i could just hold you in my arms, you know what i mean? (all i need, all i need, is just one wish, one wish)
it just feels so good
(one wish)
one little, itty, bitty wish
if i could just have one wish


damn baby..
just don't understand where we went wrong
i gave you my heart
i gave you my soul
i gave you...


as a matter of fact i was the one who said i love you first
it was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
we were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
cause, we couldn't be alone
see your mama knew i was something else, she knew how i felt
back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
growin' up i was a fool and i can't lie i'm missing you
listen and don't trip
i think i need a bottle with a genie in it
here's my wish list


first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'll make you my whole life
and you'll be my wife, make it right this time

if i had one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish


now tell me is this the only way i can get you right back in
if so then searchin' i'll go, then i can have you for sho
then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
so girl don't tell me what i'm feeling is make believe
i swear if i lose a second chance with you
i wouldn't know what to do
i'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
i couldn't be alone because without you i'm sick
here's my wish list


first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'll make you my whole life
and you'll be my wife, make it right this time
if i had one wish


i don't even know how we ended upon this road
and, even though we are grown, girl i just want you to know


if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'll make you my whole life

this man was killed
last week in new guinea.
daniel...
ryan.
the three are brothers, sir.
l've just learned
that this afternoon
their mother will get
all three telegrams.
that's not all.
there's a fourth brother.
he parachuted in the night
before the invasion.
he's somewhere in normandy.
- ls he alive?
- we don't know.
come with me.
'goddamit.'
all four were in the 29th
division, but we split them up
after the sullivan brothers died
on the juneau.
any contact
with the fourth son, james?
no, sir. he was dropped about
that's still deep
behind german lines.
there's no way to know
where the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of shaef said
the 101st is scattered to hell.
there's misdrops
all over normandy.
assuming ryan survived
the jump, he could be anywhere.
ln fact, he's probably kla.
and frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,
flat-hatting through swarms
of german reinforcements
along our axis of advance,
they're gonna be kla, too.
l have a letter here...
written a long time ago
to a mrs bixby in boston.
so bear with me.
''dear madam,
''l have been shown in the files
of the war department
''a statement of the adjutant
general of massachusetts
''that you are the mother
of five...
''sons who died gloriously
on the field of battle.
''l feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine
''that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief
''of a loss so overwhelming.
''but l cannot refrain
from tendering to you
''the consolation
that may be found
''in the thanks of the republic
they died to save.
''l pray that
our heavenly father
''may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement
''and leave only the cherished
memory of the loved lost...
''and the solemn pride
that must be yours
''to have laid so costly
a sacrifice
''upon the altar of freedom.
''yours very sincerely
and respectfully...
''abraham lincoln.''
that boy is alive.
we are gonna send somebody
to find him...
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.
yes, sir.
we expected 32 tanks,
- miller, charlie company.
- go in, captain.
lf we don't off-load
those shermans by 0600,
we'll have an entire division
stuck at carentan
with its pants
around its ankles.
well, you let me know.
have charlie company hold
vierville until we get there.
yes, sir. runner!
airborne was supposed
to win an open door for us.
they misdropped, scattered
everything into the wind.
what's your situation?
yes, sir. sector four is secure.
we took out towed 88s
here, here...and here.
they'd already gotten
four shermans
and some deuce-and-a-halves.
these two minefields
are one big one.
we tried going through,
but it turned
into a high-density field...
little bit of everything.
spreng mine 44s,
pot mines, a-200s...
the wooden bastards that the
mine detectors don't pick up.
this road here...
they placed teller mine 43s,
l guess for our tanks...
from here
to the edge of the village.
so we marked 'em,
called the engineers.
resistance?
we had higher
support expectations, sir.
there was an understrength
company without artillery.
wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
von luck kampfgruppe.
we ended up with 23 prisoners.
we turned them over to mps.
what about our casualties?
well...
the figures...
were 35 dead...
times two wounded.
they just...
didn't wanna give up those 88s.
lt was tough,
that's why you got it.
yes, sir.
john...
l've got another one for you.
- yes, sir.
- straight from the top.
we're taking a squad to neuville
on a public relations mission.
you leading a squad?
some private lost three brothers
and got a ticket home.
how come neuville?
they think he's part
of all those airborne misdrops.
lt won't be easy finding one
particular soldier.
like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.
what about the company?
we take our pick,
the rest get folded into baker.
jesus christ.
they took away your company?
lt wasn't my company. lt was
the army's. so they told me.
give me reiben on bar, jackson,
wade, beasley and caparzo.
beasley's dead.
all right, mellish, then.
we got anybody speaks french?
not that l know of.
what about talbot?
- this morning.
- oh. all right.
l'll try to dig up
another interpreter.
assemble
at battalion motor pool.
yes, sir.
- what we doing?
- listen up... what?
what we gonna do?
you're going home with a hunk
of cheese in your ass, caparzo.
you like it in the ass.
attention!
as you were.
l'm looking for corporal upham,
- timothy e.
- l'm upham, sir.
- you speak french and german?
- yes, sir.
accent?
a slight one in french.
my german's clean, sir.
you're reassigned to me.
grab your gear.
we're going to neuville.
when was this updated?
as of 0830, sir.
uh, sir...
these two axes advance south...
sir, there are germans
in neuville.
- yes, corporal.
- sir, a lot of germans.
you have a problem
with that, corporal?
no, l've never been in combat.
l make maps, translate...
l need someone who speaks
french and german.
my guys were killed.
but l haven't held a weapon
since training, sir.
- did you fire the weapon?
- yes, sir.
- then get your gear.
- yes, sir.
sir, may l...
may l bring my typewriter, sir?
yes, sir.
thank you very much, sir.
- that a souvenir?
- no, sir.
take your time, corporal.
look on the bright side,
corporal.
yes, sir.
for one thing...
you don't need to carry those.
you'll need that.
need this. yes, sir.
don't need that...
you want your head blown off?
don't fuckin' touch me
with those little rat claws.
get the fuck back in formation.
l was wondering
where you're from, that's...
caparzo, is it?
hey, drop dead, corporal.
got you.
and saluting the captain
makes him a target for germans.
so don't do it, especially
when l'm next to him.
corporal, what's
your book about?
- watch your rifle.
- sorry.
lt's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood
that develop between
soldiers during war.
brotherhood?
what do you know
about brotherhood?
get a load of this guy, fish.
ask the captain where he's from.
yeah, ask the captain.
he'll tell you everything
you wanna know.
you wanna explain
the math of this to me?
why risk the lives of the
eight of us to save one guy?
anybody wanna answer?
reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.
l got a mother, all right?
l mean, you got a mother.
sarge has got a mother.
shit, l bet even
the captain's got a mother.
well, not the captain,
but the rest of us.
''theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to do and die.''
what does that mean?
we're all supposed to die?
upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.
yes, sir.
we have orders to follow.
that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.
thank you, sir.
even if you think
the mission's fubar, sir?
especially if you think
the mission's fubar.
what's ''fubar''?
oh, it's german. yeah.
never heard of that.
sir...
l have an opinion
on this matter.
well, by all means,
share it with the squad.
well, from my way
of thinking, sir,
this entire mission is
a serious misallocation
of valuable military resources.
yeah. go on.
well, it seems to me, sir,
that god made me
a fine instrument of warfare.
reiben, pay attention.
this is the way to gripe!
continue, jackson.
what l mean, sir,
if you put me and this rifle
within one mile of adolf hitler
with a clear line
of sight, sir...
pack your bags, fellas.
war's over. amen.
oh, that's brilliant,
bumpkin.
so, captain, what about you?
you don't gripe at all?
l don't gripe to you,
reiben. l'm a captain.
there's a chain of command.
gripes go up, not down.
you gripe to me, l gripe
to my superiors and so on.
l don't gripe to you
or in front of you.
l'm sorry, sir, but, uh...
let's say you weren't a captain.
what would you say then?
well, in that case,
l'd say this is
an excellent mission, sir,
with an extremely valuable
objective, sir,
worthy of
my best efforts, sir.
moreover...l feel
heartfelt sorrow
for the mother
of private james ryan
and will lay down my life
and the lives of my men,
especially you, reiben,
to ease her suffering.
- he's good.
- l love him.
right.
thunder!
flash!
upham, over there.
reiben, you four go.
go, go, go, go, go.
you're a welcome sight.
our relief showed up.
how many are you?
just eight. we're not
your relief. sorry.
what do you mean, sir?
we're here for a private ryan.
who? ryan? what for?
- ls he here?
- l don't know.
maybe on the other side of town.
the germans cut us in two.
- what's his name again?
- ryan. james ryan.
he dropped in with 101st.
- goldman, get me a runner.
- runner!
come on.
jonesy, make a hole there!
we got stopped by intense rifle
action from the eastward.
the germans have been
reinforcing regiments all day.
lt's been quiet
for about 45 minutes.
most of the german fire
is concentrated to the westward.
who's on the loudspeaker?
that's dagwood dsseldorf,
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.
the statue of liberty is kaputt.
''the statue of liberty
is kaputt.''
that's disconcerting.
take the second left...
your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!
private ryan, james,
probably misdropped with 101 .
- got that?
- cover!
go!
those sadistic fuckin' animals!
get down.
they know we're not in contact,
they'll get the runners.
why keep shooting him?
long as he lives,
he carries the message.
- we'd do the same.
- we wouldn't!
- get ready to travel.
- yes, sir.
try again to let captain hamill
know we're coming.
what's the rest
of neuville like?
uh, next block's got
two-storey buildings both sides.
a lotta windows
and a square on the left.
- show me.
- sarge, hold right here.
yes, sir.
let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.
try a left hook.
two of yours, two of mine.
hastings, goldman, up front!
reiben, caparzo.
fundamentals. short runs.
high and low at the corners.
be prepared for close contact.
go. upham,
stay with sergeant horvath.
stay right here.
l'll wear him like underwear!
stay with me.
past the end
are the gates to the square.
good.
reiben,
where's the captain from?
figure that out,
you got yourself a prize.
company's got a pool.
five bucks gets you in.
easy.
lt's around this corner.
defilade up to those gates.
somebody must know
where he's from.
been with him since kasserine
pass, and l don't know.
my ankles are killing me.
l'll need a wheelchair
before this is over.
ow! that's it. oh, my god.
got ankles like an old woman.
like an old...
reiben.
so you don't even know
where he went to school?
captain didn't go to school,
they assembled him
out of gl body parts.
pay attention to detail.
l know where he's from 'cause
l pay attention to detail.
hey, upham...
careful you don't step
in the bullshit.
do it.
thunder!
thunder, or we will fire on you!
upham, tell them
to show themselves.
ask where the germans are.
what's he saying?
the children.
take the children.
no, we can't take the kids.
we can't take the kids! no!
they think
they'll be safe with us.
lt's not gonna be safe with us!
are you nuts?!
listen to the captain!
they think
they'll be safe, sir.
not gonna be safe anywhere.
put that kid back!
put that little girl back!
caparzo,
give that kid back now!
upham, how do you say
''lt's ok''?
she reminds me of my niece, sir.
get the kid back up there!
captain, we could take her
down the road to the next town.
we're not here
to do the decent thing!
we're here to follow
fuckin' orders!
sarge, take this goddamn kid!
cover! cover!
come on. no!
goddamit!
where'd that come from?
he was on the ground
before we heard.
that's where l'd be.
l didn't see it.
maybe a shade under.
l wouldn't venture
out there, fellas!
this sniper's got talent!
please don't cry. l'll take you
back to your parents.
please don't cry. come on.
captain.
hold on, caparzo.
help me up.
l can walk. l can walk.
caparzo, stay still!
all right.
two clicks, left wind.
captain, can you see him
from there? how is he?
wade, you stay put.
where's he shot, captain?
- can you see him?
- stay there!
damn it, stay down!
what's up with you?
what if you get hit? huh?
fish, come over here.
carpy, put your head down.
put your head down.
o my god, l trust in thee.
let me not be ashamed.
let not my enemies
triumph over me.
copy it.
copy it and send it for me.
you're gonna send it.
put it down!
- lt's got blood!
- l see it.
lt's... lt's to my dad.
lt's got blood on it.
we got him.
stay down.
how bad is it?
chest, maybe lung shot.
get that 30 up the street!
detail!
clear up!
clear down!
that's why
we can't take children.
sergeant horvath,
do an ammo check.
upham... canteens.
fill 'em up.
- sergeant hill.
- yes, sir.
gather your men. we'll form up
at the north-west corner.
mellish, check the tower.
right now. go!
fuck ryan.
- thunder!
- flash!
come on in.
hey, guys, we're looking
for captain hamill.
somewhere across the square.
across the square.
go easy. watch for snipers.
take it easy. sit down.
jimmy t, find captain hamill,
bring him in here.
what? up there?
how should l know?
would you go look, please?
thank you, you moron.
all right.
you guys just flake out
here for a while.
let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.
jesus!
drop your weapons!
drop 'em now!
drop the fucking weapons!
l'll shoot you! l'll shoot!
drop! drop! drop 'em!
now! put 'em down!
clear up!
shit.
shit!
clear up!
clear down!
enough to make you old.
let's hope so.
fred hamill, pathfinders 101st.
john miller, 2nd rangers.
thank you.
we're looking for
private james ryan.
he's part of your outfit.
any chance you policed him up?
- how was the road in?
- scenic.
we lost most of our ammo.
and one of our men.
lieutenant, redeploy that
bazooka to the right side.
yes, sir!
and get ryan up here.
ryan!
ryan, front and centre!
ryan!
here comes our boy.
told you he was an asshole.
sir, private ryan reporting.
at ease.
captain miller, 2nd rangers.
he wants a word with you.
this way.
all right.
take a knee.
private, l have some bad news.
well, there isn't any easy
way to say this, so, uh...
so l'll just say it -
your brothers are dead.
we have, uh, orders
to come get you...
'cause you're going home.
oh, my god.
my brothers are dead.
l was gonna take 'em fishing
when we got home.
l'm so sorry, james.
l can't tell you how much.
how...how did they die?
they were killed in action.
no, that can't be.
they're both...
that...that can't be.
my brothers are still
in grammar school.
you're james ryan?
yeah.
james francis ryan from lowa?
james frederick ryan, minnesota.
well, does that...does that
mean my brothers are ok?
yeah, l'm sure they're fine.
are you sure they're ok,
though?
we're looking for
a different private ryan.
how do you know?
how do you know the foul-up
isn't that his brothers
are ok and that...
lieutenant,
l'm sorry for the trouble.
l just wrote them a letter...
l got to get home.
l got to get home right now.
shh, take it easy.
- where's our ryan?
- l don't know.
you in touch with your co?
- that figures.
- what unit's he in?
baker company, 506.
- the guy with the broken foot?
- charlie, l think.
you think? yeah.
ryan? don't know... man!
where was your drop zone?
just inside of vierville.
vierville?
how did you end up here?
you got me, sir.
c-47 took heavy fire.
pilot tried to get out,
turning every which way.
took more fire in the drop.
got messy. l ended up here.
l haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.
anybody there have a big mouth,
say where the drop was?
no, sir, but they had
the same rally point as us.
show me.
my men are beat.
we'll hold up for three hours
then pull out after dark.
got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?
something with clean sheets
and room service?
how about a nice comfy church?
- we'll take that.
- any news?
how's it all falling together?
well, we got
the beachhead secure.
problem is monty's taking
his time moving on caen.
we can't pull out
till he's ready, so...
that guy's overrated.
no argument here.
you got to take caen
so you can take saint-lo.
take saint-lo to take valognes.
valognes, you got cherbourg.
and cherbourg, you got paris.
paris, you get berlin.
then that big boat home.
we sure could
use you around here,
but l understand
what you're doing.
you do?
yeah. l got a couple
of brothers myself.
- oh.
- good luck.
thank you.
no, l mean it.
find him. get him home.
what's with your hand?
l don't know.
lt started when they brought
us down for embarkation.
lt comes and goes.
you may have to get
yourself a new job.
this one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.
what?
- what?
- nothing.
what was the name
of that kid at anzio?
he was always walking around
on his hands,
and singing that song about
the man on the flying trapeze?
yeah, vecchio.
he was a goofy kid.
remember he used to pee
a ''v'' on everybody's jacket,
for vecchio.
for victory.
vecchio.
he was so short.
- wasn't he a midget?
- how did he become a ranger?
got shot in the foot once.
he could walk faster
on his hands.
he could run faster
on his hands than...
you see, when...you end up
killing one of your men,
you tell yourself it happened
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.
maybe a hundred others.
do you know how many men
l've lost under my command?
- how many?
- 94.
but that means
l've saved the lives
of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?
maybe even 20, right?
and that's how simple it is.
that's how you...
that's how you rationalise
making the choice
between the mission and the men.
except this time,
this mission is a man.
this ryan better be worth it.
he'd better go home
and cure some disease
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.
l wouldn't trade 10 ryans
for one vecchio or one caparzo.
amen.
look. there it goes again.
sir...
are you all right?
look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.
why don't you get some sleep?
l don't know how he does it.
what's that?
falls asleep like that.
look at him.
he's lights-out
the minute his head's down.
clear conscience.
what's that saying? ''lf god's
on our side, who's on theirs?''
''lf god be for us,
who could be against us?''
yeah, what did l say?
well, actually,
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.
how is that, wade?
my mother was an intern,
she worked late nights,
slept through the day,
so the only time we got to talk
was when she'd get home.
so l used to lie in my bed
and try to stay awake,
but it never worked
'cause the harder l tried,
the faster l'd fall asleep.
that wouldn't have
mattered in my house.
my ma would've shook me awake,
chatted till dawn.
that woman
was never too tired to talk.
probably the only time
she could get a word in.
funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,
and l'd pretend to be asleep.
who? you...your mom?
yeah.
she'd stand in the doorway
looking at me.
and l'd just keep my eyes shut.
l knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,
that she came home early...
just to talk to me.
and l still wouldn't move.
l'd still pretend
to just be asleep.
l don't know why l did that.
we only got a couple hours.
go to sleep.
captain? sir?
corporal?
how you doin' there?
you all right?
yeah, l think this is
all good for me, sir.
really?
how is that?
''war educates the senses,
''calls into action the will,
''perfects the physical
constitution,
''brings men into such
swift and close collision
''in critical moments
that man measures man.''
yeah, well, l guess
that's emerson's way
of finding the bright side.
- you know emerson, sir?
- l know some.
so where are you from, captain?
what'd you do before the war?
what's the pool up to?
you know, l think
it's around 300, sir.
well, when it gets up to 500,
l'll tell you and we'll split
the money, how about that?
well, sir, l feel it's my duty
under your command
to suggest we wait until
it gets to a thousand, sir.
what if we don't
live that long?
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.
yes, sir.
yeah.
get some sleep, corporal.
yes, sir.
who's got sulphur powder?
medic! my buddy's bleeding!
he needs a tourniquet!
- wade.
- yes, sir?
- do what you can.
- yes, sir.
hold on, fellas.
lt won't be much longer.
how we doing here?
all right.
yeah, doing all right.
don't worry about it.
doc's in town.
lt's all right.
lt's all right.
the 29th lnfantry's breaking
through, they'll be here soon.
plasma. anybody got plasma?
- captain. hey, captain.
- soldier, want to fill me in?
uh, yeah.
lieutenant dewindt, sir.
carrying 327th glider lnfantry.
this one was mine.
l was the pilot. 22 dead.
l ended up without a scratch.
took my co-pilot's head off.
well, who are these people?
the guys we came with,
they headed off first night.
other guys keep showing up.
one, two, half-dozen at a time.
then some officer'll
patch together a mixed unit,
head off to make trouble, sir.
we're looking for
private james ryan.
baker company, 506 of the 101st.
no, you got me, sir.
a lot of guys
come in and out of here.
check that squad.
- see if ryan's in it.
- yes, sir.
smell that leg right there.
ls it south of cheese?
what?
keep moving. keep moving!
l'm juden, you know?
ju-den.
yeah, l couldn't
pry him out of there,
- l'd need a winch.
- yeah.
stars.
yep, brigadier general amend,
deputy commander, 101st.
some fucking genius
had the idea
of welding steel plates on
to keep the general safe
from ground fire.
unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me
until we were getting airborne.
that's like flying
a freight train.
ok?
gross overload.
trim characteristics
all shot to hell.
l nearly broke both my arms
keeping her level.
and when...and when we released,
l cut as hard as l could,
tried to gain altitude
and still keep from stalling.
came down like a fucking meteor.
here's how we ended up.
and the others,
they stopped easy enough
ok, though, you know?
we were just...we were
just too damn heavy, you know?
the grass was wet.
downward slope and all.
all that for a general?
one man.
- lot of that going around.
- fubar.
fubar.
fubar.
fubar.
y'all got that right.
l looked in a german dictionary.
there's no ''fubar'' in there.
- upham.
- yes, sir?
there's more paratroops.
find out if one's ryan.
yes, sir.
you might want
to check these out, sir.
dog tags.
more than l really
want to count, sir.
l've...l've covered
a lot of bodies, sir.
jackson...
start going through those.
yes, sir.
l'll help.
what do you think? he in there?
lf he is, l'll find him.
l bet he is.
- who we got...?
- you don't stand a chance.
- you think he's in here?
- just keep looking.
all right. gary lanico.
ben rubino. mike cessacchio.
all the guineas
are buying it, huh?
oh, come on,
not the right name.
wee willie winkie,
that's your buddy.
we gotta find this prick.
where is this sonofabitch?
don't mix them up?
keep them in your pile.
how will l know who's here?
why don't you just shut up,
reiben, all right?
everybody be friends.
cranky there, huh?
l got a winner.
what you talking about?
ryan.
ryan?
look at that, mellish.
you're a genius, you really are.
r-l-e-n-n-e.
that's rienne. that's french.
you know what that means?
lt means nothing.
- three of a kind.
- all from new york.
do you need
a hand with that?
l got a full house.
got you beat. straight flush.
you were looking at my tags.
you're cheating, you know?
ryan.
fuckin' unreal, this guy.
do you need a hand with that?
can you read that shit?
jesus, look at
this poor bastard.
they're not bulletproof, huh?
guess not. all right?
what's between his ears?
sort of what you
fellas got between your legs.
we got to give him that.
not bad, jackson.
what the hell are you doing?
the whole airborne's watching.
these aren't chips.
- all right, all right.
- put 'em back in!
he's not here.
put 'em back.
maybe we should split
into groups, huh?
wander the woods,
calling his name.
he'll hear us
sooner or later. ryan!
that might be a little hard
to do, captain.
maybe the locals... hey, you
know... uh, excusez-moi.
parlez-vous ryan, james ryan?
merci. merci beaucoup.
ryan! anybody know ryan,
ryan? you know a guy named ryan?
private james ryan from lowa?
anybody know a ryan?
james ryan?!
hey, joe, doesn't,
uh, michaelson
pal around with a ryan
from ''c'' company?
l think so.
bring him up here, would you?
you know private ryan?
you're gonna have
to speak up, sir.
speak up, sir!
my hearing's not good!
lt comes and goes!
a grenade went off by me!
got it, got it.
do you know private ryan?
who?
- private ryan? james ryan?
- jimmy ryan?
james. james francis ryan.
no, no, no. james francis ryan.
get me a pencil,
something to write on.
quick! come on, a pencil!
a small one, sir.
write this down.
james francis ryan,
question mark.
lowa, question mark.
do you know know him?
read the message. look.
yeah. of course
l know him, sir.
where is he?
yeah, yeah.
we missed our drop zone
by 20 miles,
ended up by bumville
or some damn place.
we were coming here
to the rally point,
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men
- to go to, uh...ramelle...
- ramelle.
babysitting a bridge.
that's all l know, sir.
great! great!
thank...thank you.
write ''thank you.''
read, and thank you.
you're welcome!
assemble on me.
thank you, lieutenant.
ramelle.
we're here. there.
ramelle...
is on the merderet river,
just south-west of us.
you know anything about
this bridge, captain?
yep. the target has
always been cherbourg.
we can't push on paris
without a deep water port,
rommel knows that,
so he's gonna try to get
his armour across the river.
then he can hit us in the flank
when we turn to cherbourg.
that makes any village with a
bridge solid-gold real estate.
let's go.
captain.
what the hell is that?
a radar site.
must be out of action.
looks like there's
something in that...
sandbag bunker
right under the station.
see it?
yeah. that's my guess, too.
what is it?
machine gun. probably mg-42.
jesus. ls that
what got those guys?
maybe one of them's our boy.
no, their patches are 82nd.
l don't know
how fast you guys are,
but let's detour this way,
they'll never know we were here.
so, captain,
let's just go around it.
l hear what you're saying,
but we can't.
l'm with reiben
on this one, sir.
- we left them 88s.
- for the air force.
the air force won't spend
ordinance on one machine gun.
uh, captain...
we skip it and still
accomplish our mission.
l mean, this isn't
our mission, right?
that's what you want to do,
just leave it here?
let them ambush
the next company?
no, sir, l'm simply saying, it
seems like an unnecessary risk
given our objective, sir.
our objective is to win the war.
sir, l just, uh, l don't have
a good feeling about this one.
when was the last time
you felt good about anything?
all right, three runners
with suppressing fire.
mellish, you hook to the right.
l'll go up the middle.
who's going left?
who's going left?
l'll do it.
l'll go left.
all right.
upham, switch off with jackson,
and you linger in the rear.
yes, sir.
we keep pressure on till
he has to change his barrels.
l think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.
- l should take the middle, sir.
- the way you run?
- maybe l should go left, sir.
- maybe you should shut up.
reiben, base of fire.
mags and clips where
you can reach 'em, and...
and extra grenades
for the base runners.
hill's clear!
four down and dead!
upham, grab the gear.
get up here!
we need water
and extra dressing now!
get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!
get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!
son of a bitch!
get some sulphur on there.
move my legs up.
more sulphur, mellish.
you're gonna be all right, doc.
how's it look?
wade, you're going
on a hospital ship.
more sulphur!
put my legs up.
put my legs up.
l got 'em. l got 'em. l got 'em.
upham, give me your canteen!
come on. come on. come on.
put some pressure on it.
- you'll be ok.
- how's it look?
- give him morphine.
- how's it look?
- all right.
- how's it look?
here comes the morphine.
am l shot in the spine?
- you're ok, wade.
am l shot in the spine?
lift him up. easy, easy, easy.
put some pressure on him.
easy, easy.
lift him up.
lt's ok, doc. lt's all right.
wade, you got an exit wound.
lt's in the small of your back.
how big...how big's
the hole in the...
lt's about the size of an acorn.
you're fine.
put some pressure on it.
put some pressure on it.
put some pressure on it.
lt's all right.
put some more pressure on it!
ls there anything bleeding
worse than the others?
yeah, right here.
do you know what it is?
no.
here. l'll put your hand on it.
pressure on there.
right there. ok? that's the one.
oh, my god, my liver!
oh, my god! lt's my liver!
tell us what to do.
tell us how to fix you.
what can we do?
tell us what to do.
oh, shit.
l could use...l could use
a little more morphine.
more morphine, sir?
give it to him.
give it to him.
l don't wanna die.
here you go, wade. here you go.
there you go. there you...
give him another one.
mama?
mama?
l want to go home.
l want to go home.
mama! mama! mam...
reiben, hold him!
not yet.
first, make him mark and cover
wade's body for grave detail.
same thing for
those paratroopers down there.
strip that stuff.
check for intelligence.
ask if he's the one
who shot wade.
- lt doesn't matter.
- lt does matter!
shut up with that
filthy pig latin.
jackson, you're hit.
shut up.
- lt just skinned me, sir.
- get it dressed.
you and sarge
watch the perimeter.
he says please don't shoot.
l don't care, upham.
sir? sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?
- this is not right, sir.
- help him with the bodies.
what is happening?
american.
l like american.
steamboat willie.
steamboat willie.
yeah, steamboat willie.
american.
he's says he's not finished.
that's what you think.
please...
l like america.
fancy schmancy! what a cinch!
go fly a kite! cat got
your tongue! cool beans!
betty boop! what a dish!
betty grable. nice gams.
l say can you see...
l say can you see...
l...l say...
fuck hitler.
fuck hitler.
sir, he says
he's sorry about wade.
he says he's sorry
about wade, sir.
captain!
captain, this isn't right!
you know this. he's a prisoner.
he surrendered.
he surrendered, sir!
tell him...
to march a thousand paces, then
he can take off the blindfold.
we'll be gone, and he turns
himself in to allied patrols.
- we're letting him go?
- he's a pow, reiben.
can't take him with us.
our guys'll pick him up.
lf he isn't picked up
by the wehrmacht,
then thrown back
into circulation.
captain, you just
let the enemy go.
this is such bullshit.
y'all got that right.
bullshit? this is bullshit?
shooting prisoners is ok?
lt's against the goddamn rules!
the rules just walked
off with your friend.
but l guess that was
the decent thing to do,
huh, captain?
get your gear. let's go.
you heard him. gear up.
the captain
just gave you an order.
yeah. like the one
to take this machine gun.
that was a real doozie, sarge.
soldier, you're outta line.
yes, sir, one hell of a call,
to take this nest.
but, what the hell,
we only lost one guy.
l hope mama ryan's happy
knowing that little jimmy's life
is more important than our guys!
but then, we haven't
found him yet, have we?
get the hell off me!
reiben, get up.
gear up. fall in.
l'm done with this mission.
sir.
don't walk away from your
captain, get back in line.
l'll go to the stockade
if l have to.
- l won't ask again.
- captain!
this is bullshit!
fall in!
- you'd shoot me over ryan?
- no, l don't like you.
just let him go!
are you letting this happen?
captain! you see this?
- captain? sir? ryan's dead.
- bullshit!
- sir, we have a situation.
- l have a sixth sense, l know.
you don't kill krauts,
but you shoot me, huh?
- he's better than you.
- do it. put one in my leg...
l'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!
put your money where your...
you don't know when to shut up.
captain, please!
what's the pool on me up to?
what?
- you coward son of a bitch!
- l'm waiting, sarge.
mike, what's the pool
on me up to now?
what...what's it up to?
what is it, $300?
ls that it, 300?
l'm a schoolteacher.
l teach english composition
in this little town called
addley, pennsylvania.
the last 1 1 years,
l've been at
thomas alva edison high school.
l was the coach
of the baseball team.
l'll be doggone.
back home, when l'd tell people
what l do for a living,
they'd think,
''well, that figures.''
but over here, it's a...
a big...
a big mystery.
so l guess l've changed some.
sometimes l wonder
if l've changed so much,
my wife will even recognise me
whenever l get back to her.
and how l'll ever be able to...
to tell her
about days like today.
ah, ryan...
l don't know anything
about ryan. l don't care.
the man means nothing to me,
just a name. but if...
lf finding him
so he can go home,
lets me get back to my wife,
well, then...
then that's my mission.
you want to leave?
you want to go off
and fight the war?
all right.
all right, l won't stop you.
l'll even put in the paperwork.
l just know, every man l kill,
the farther from home l feel.
by memories
of days gone by
ln my solitude
you taunt me
with memories
that never die
l sit in my chair
filled with despair
there's no one
could be so sad
with gloom everywhere
l sit and l stare...
half-track! cover!
who's doing the shooting?
who's doing the shooting?
move on their left flank!
take their left flank!
hold on, make sure they're down!
that was a recon element,
second ss.
we've been expecting a probe.
that must have been it.
captain miller,
charlie company, 2nd rangers.
corporal henderson,
easy company, five-o-first.
ryan, first
of the five-o-sixth.
pfc toynbe,
third of the five-o-sixth.
james francis ryan?
yes, sir. how'd you guess that?
looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.
yes, sir. small unit action.
they beat the hell
out of us with 88s.
sir, if you're our relief,
l'm gonna file a complaint.
l wouldn't blame you.
who's your co?
lt would have been
captain jennings, sir.
the best we can muster now
is a corporal.
so, what are you guys
all about?
we're here for him. ryan.
me, sir?
james francis ryan of lowa?
yes, sir.
payton, lowa, that's correct.
what is this about?
your brothers
were killed in combat.
which...which ones?
all of them.
uh...on...on the level?
yeah. l'm afraid so.
uh...you might want
to take some time with this.
lf there's someplace
you want to go and...
- what's this all about?
- ryan lost his brothers.
- which one?
- all of them.
you...
you came all the way
out here to tell me that?
well, you're...
you're going home.
our orders are
to bring you back.
bring me back?
corporal henderson...l don't
mean to leave you short-handed,
but orders are orders.
when are you being relieved?
sir, we have no way to tell.
my orders don't include me
abandoning my post.
l understand that,
but this changes things.
l don't see that it does, sir.
the chief of staff for the
united states army says it does.
sir, we have
to hold this bridge.
the 82nd have taken out
every bridge across the merderet
except two,
at valognes and here.
lf the germans take 'em,
we'll have to displace.
private, your outfit stays,
but your party's over here.
sir, l can't leave
until reinforcements...
you got three minutes.
sir, what about them?
there's barely...
hey, asshole!
two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?
sir?
that's right.
what were their names?
lrwin wade and adrian caparzo.
wade and...
caparzo.
lt doesn't make any sense.
lt doesn't make sense, sir.
why do l deserve to go?
why not these guys?
they fought just as hard!
ls that what they're
supposed to tell your mother
when they send her another
folded american flag?
tell her that when you found me,
l was here with the only
brothers l have left,
and that there's no way
l was gonna desert them.
l think she'll understand that.
there's no way
l'm leaving this bridge.
what are your orders?
sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.
the world has taken
a turn for the surreal.
clearly, but the question
still stands.
l don't know. what do you think?
you don't want to know
what l think.
no, mike, l do.
well... part of me
thinks the kid's right.
what's he done to deserve this?
lf he wants to stay here,
fine, let's leave him.
yeah.
but another part
of me thinks...
what if by some miracle we stay
and actually make it
out of here?
someday we might look
back and decide
that saving private ryan
was the one decent thing
we were able to pull out of this
whole god-awful, shitty mess.
that's what l was thinking, sir.
like you said, captain,
if we do that...we all earn
the right to go home.
oh, brother.
this is everything.
two .30-calibre machine guns,
you got two bazookas,
but only eight rounds left,
and assorted small arms.
an arty round took out
our .60 mortar.
might as well be spit wads
if they use tanks.
- which they're sure to.
- what you thinking, sir?
well...
l think they're going to try
to whip around the flanks...
unless we draw them up
here between these buildings,
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.
- disable him?
- lf we can.
make the tank a 60-ton
roadblock, we'll have a chance.
yes, sir,
don't let them mass anywhere.
hit hard and fall back
to the bridge.
machine gun moving, number two
up high to piss on their heads.
that would be the idea.
jackson?
lf we can, l'd like to get
you up in that bell tower.
- yes, sir.
- give you company if need be.
yes, sir. company couldn't hurt.
l'd say a .30 with about
parker, job opportunity.
not the worst idea, captain.
but it all depends on knocking
out the tank here, right?
so how do you
plan on doing that?
reiben's right.
as our esteemed colleague
from the airborne pointed out,
what we got here is spit wads,
so how do we stop the tank?
give it a rabbit to chase.
we could hit the tank
in the tracks.
yeah, but with what?
we could try a sticky bomb.
sticky bomb, sir?
- sir, are you making that up?
- no. lt's in the field manual.
well, we're out
of field manuals, sir.
perhaps you can enlighten us?
right, you have demolition -
some tnt or composition b?
l got that bridge wired
with enough to blow it twice.
you can spare some, then.
you take
a standard-issue gl sock,
cram it with as much
comp' b as possible,
rig up a simple fuse,
then coat the whole
thing with axle grease.
when you throw it,
it should stick.
lt's a bomb that sticks.
a sticky bomb.
you know a better way to knock
the tracks off a tank, tell me.
this is good. now we got
to surrender our socks.
haul away.
select the field of fire.
cross with the bell tower.
l can cover 1 2 to nine here.
- easy!
- l got her!
here are the mines.
for being the best we can do,
that forward machine gun is not
in a terrible firing position.
and this position right here...
this is the alamo.
they push us back here,
last man blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second fuse,
so that last man better hurry,
or he won't be alive long.
captain?
where am l during all this?
never more than two feet from
me, and that's not negotiable.
l'll get some ammo. come on.
- upham.
- yes.
- listen, all right?
- yeah.
- listening?
- yes.
all right, we'll be displacing
and falling back like crazy...
so be johnny-on-the-spot
with ammo or we're dead.
- right.
- understand?
- johnny-on-the-spot.
- you all right?
yeah.
when we shipped out of england,
l told the supply sergeant
handing out cigarettes,
''l don't smoke.''
''l don't smoke.''
quite a situation, huh?
unbelievable.
here.
fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?
yeah, you got that right.
fubar.
- yeah, well...
- fubar.
lt'll be a real show, huh?
take it easy.
fubar.
who's that singing, sir?
edith piaf.
what's she so upset about?
her lover left her,
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.
that would do it.
''even life itself
''only represents you.
''sometimes l dream
that l'm in your arms.''
what was that part?
she sang that before.
the chorus.
''and you speak softly
in my ear...
''and you say things
''that make my eyes close,
''and l find that marvellous.''
uh, again...upham, uh...
to be honest, l...l find myself
curiously aroused by you.
marvellous. no, it's...
it's a melancholy song.
at the beginning, she says,
''and then one day, you left.
''you left me, and, uh...
l've been desperate ever since.
''l see you all over the sky,
l see you all over the earth.''
any more of this, the krauts
won't have to shoot me.
l'll just slit my own wrists.
you're a strange bird, upham.
sorry, it's edith, you know.
you know what
that song reminds me of?
what mrs rachel troubowitz
said when l left for basic.
what, ''don't touch me''?
no. mrs rachel troubowitz
is our super's wife.
she tries things on in my mom's
shop, and she's, like, a 44-ee.
- double-e?
- these things are massive.
those are big.
l've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42-d.
so she's trying to squeeze
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned,
triple-panel girdle
with the shelf-lift brassiere.
and it's beautiful,
she's just pouring out of it.
lt's beautiful, and she can tell
l got a hard-on the size
of the statue of liberty.
and she says,
''richard, calm down.''
and says,
''when you're over there,
''if you see anything
that upsets you,
''just close your eyes and think
of these. you understand?''
so l said, ''yes, ma'am.''
are you all right, sir?
yeah, just keeping the rhythm.
ls it true you were
a teacher back home?
yes.
see, that's something
l could never do
not after the way we treated
our teachers. no, sir.
l had a thousand kids like you.
l can't see my brothers' faces.
l've been trying,
and l can't see them.
has that ever happened to you?
you gotta think of a context.
what does that mean?
well, you think about
something specific...
something you've done together.
when l think of home,
l think of something specific.
l think of my hammock
in the backyard or...
my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night,
two of my brothers came
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,
and they said they had
a surprise for me.
they took me to the barn,
into the loft, and...
there was
my oldest brother dan...
with alice...alice jardine.
l mean...picture a girl who took
a nosedive from the ugly tree
and hit every branch
coming down.
and...and dan's
got her shirt off.
so he's working on this bra,
and all of a sudden,
sean just screams out...
''danny, you're a young man!
don't do it!''
and alice jardine screams,
and jumps up,
and tries to get out,
but this shirt's over her head,
and she runs into the wall
and knocks herself out.
so now dan is so mad,
he starts coming after us,
but alice is there unconscious,
he's gotta wake her up.
so he grabs her leg,
and he's dragging her.
and he picks up a shovel
and goes after sean.
sean says, ''why are you trying
to hit me? l did you a favour.''
and this makes dan more angry.
he tries to swing this thing.
lt goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.
the thing explodes, and
the whole barn almost goes up.
that was it...dan went
to basic next day.
that was the last night
the four of us were together.
that was two years ago.
tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.
no.
no. that one l save just for me.
enemy from the east.
he sees tiger tanks, two of 'em.
panzer tanks, two of 'em.
lnfantry,
disperse! you know what to do!
reiben, get on the rabbit.
upham, get some cover.
mellish and henderson,
lock and load!
everybody check your ammo!
good luck, reiben.
l was born lucky, sarge.
one in five tracer?
yep, and tracers
point both ways.
yeah? check her head space
and she should run.
upham! hustle up!
- corporal upham?
- yes, sir.
we don't have
a .30-calibre here.
either mr mellish
or mr jackson needs that.
yes, sir.
upham! jackson's fine.
turn around to mellish.
l don't know if they
took the bait, captain.
you got any more of that?
panzers didn't take the bait.
lnfantry's moving to the left.
half-track just went by
with about 20 troops.
displace!
do it now! light it!
you! light it!
get over there and stop 'em!
displace!
upham!
clear!
krauts!
right flank!
sanitater!
get down! get down!
upham! upham! .30-cal! hurry!
and find the captain!
this flank's going to fold!
reversing!
he's still in this fight!
no, no, ryan, get down!
get down!
- ryan.
- get off me!
- you all right?
- get off me!
l'm fine, too, captain(!)
ok, both sides!
get a grenade in there!
grenade!
- 20-mil!
- 20-mil!
flak gun. take it out!
heavy weapon below!
l ain't got a shot!
pincer move, parker!
targets eight o'clock low!
shit!
god grant me strength.
come on! displace!
come on!
cover, upham! cover!
cover!
l'm out of .30-calibre.
blessed be the lord,
my strength,
which teaches my hands to war.
my goodness and my fortress...
my high tower
and my deliverer...
my shield
and he in whom l trust.
parker, get down!
captain, that 20-millimetre's
killing us.
we gotta try to flank it.
well, let me get over
for the top shot.
upham, ammo, goddamit!
l'm jammed! l'm jammed!
got any .30-cal?
- l'm out.
- shit.
l'm out! l need a bandolier!
anybody got a bandolier?
god! god!
you stupid...
let's stop. listen to me!
listen to me! stop!
no! d-d-d-d...stop. stop.
son of...son of a bitch!
son of a bitch! son of a bitch!
son of a bitch!
son of a bitch!
l'm out.
those .60 rounds.
we can use them
without the tube.
how?
fuse-arming wire, set back,
heave it!
panzer schreck!

james... earn this.
earn it.
my dear mrs ryan,
it's with a
profound sense of joy
that l write to inform you
your son private james ryan
is well and,
at this very moment,
on his way home
from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate
james did his duty in combat
with great courage
and steadfast dedication
even after informed
of the tragic loss
your family has suffered
in this great campaign
to rid the world
of tyranny and oppression.
l take great pleasure in joining
the secretary of war,
the united states army
and the citizens
of a grateful nation
in wishing you good health
and many years of happiness
with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe
return of a beloved son,
can compensate you or the
thousands of other families
who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war.
l share with you
some words which sustained me
through long, dark nights
of peril, loss and heartache.
and l quote,
''l pray that
our heavenly father
''may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement
''and leave you only
the cherished memory
''of the loved and lost
''and the solemn pride
that must be yours
''to have laid
so costly a sacrifice
''upon the alter of freedom.
''abraham lincoln.''
yours very sincerely
and respectfully,
george c marshall,
general, chief of staff.
my family is with me today.
they wanted to come with me.
to be honest with you,
l wasn't sure how l'd feel
coming back here.
every day l think about
what you said to me
that day on the bridge.
and l've tried to live my life
the best l could.
l hope that was enough.
l hope that,
at least in your eyes,
l've earned what all of you
have done for me.
james.
captain john h miller.
tell me l've led a good life.
what?
tell me l'm a good man.
you are."

my mind is telling me to stay but my heart wants to leave


said i'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping with the one i love
oh, because the one i'm with is good to me
but he just ain't good enough, oh


yes, i've tried to shake it off, and i even tried to pray
but i'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me
see he offered me the earth, but instead chose space
i found about the cost, but it's a price i'm willing to pay


that's why i'm sleeping, sleeping with the one i love
that's why i'm sleeping, i'm sleeping i'm sleeping
sleeping with the one i love
cause the one who's here with me, he's good to me
but he just ain't good enough
my love, my love, my love


see my baby's like a dream but the other man, he haunts me
one is here with me but the other's got me where he wants me
yes i got a man, but i'm still feeling lonely
tell you what i'm gonna do
do, do, do

felt you staring at me and immediately i had no doubt
missed your flight, we spent the week together but it's all over now
'cause we tried to keep it going when we got home but our heads were in the clouds


so i'm waiting for the sun to come up

let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'til the stars are above
wish that you would talk to me

got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
kinda makes me wonder
why you playin' with me?
kinda makes me wonder
do you think of me?
kinda makes me wonder

thought we'd never drift but i can't lie
we faded
grass ain't always greener on the other side

would you be a tyrant
if i gave you power

look me in my iris
i can read your silence
when everything is a riot
you're my peace and quiet


all around we go
your lovin' is like a kaleidoscope
i don't wanna come down
keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
and 'round and 'round and 'round
wanna seize the throne
but what would you do with all that control
i don't wanna come down
keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
and 'round and 'round and 'round


word on the street, you got hoes
i disappear like el chapo
'til you said you would cut off the whole world
if little old me would be yours

Used To Love You|Yuna|r&b|"
i wonder if you think about me
now that you're out there on your own
you made it seem so easy
i wanna be just like you
i wonder if your heart is healing
you're going out so often now
i see the boys are helping you out
are they just like you?


no regrets, no looking back now
never left, you let me back down, no, no, no


used to love you, used to care but no more
i used to love you, used to care but no more
i used to love you, used to care but no more
i'm better than before


i can never understand why
i'm depending on a guy
to make me feel like i was special
i am special when i'm mine
keep running on in circles
i was such a slave for love
now that i know better
i know better of my worth
i was young and i was foolish
giving up my heart so easy
to someone who didn't love me like i do
i was young and i was foolish
all i needed was my spirit
and someone will come and love me like i do


no regrets, no looking back now
never left, you let me back down, no, no, no


used to love you, used to care but no more
i used to love you, used to care but no more
i used to love you, used to care but no more
i'm better than before


used to love you
i used to love you
used to love you
used to love you
used to love you


used to love you, used to care but no more
i used to love you, used to care but no more
i used to love you, used to care but no more

If You Love Me|Brownstone|r&b|"
i don't wanna rain on this parade
but i'm starting to question the oath that was made
i'm not looking for just an affair
want a love that is based on truth, not just dare


you will not hurt my pride
if right now you decide
that you are not ready to settle down
but if you want my heart
then it's time that you start
to act like you're mine, in the light and the dark


if you love me, say it
if you trust me, do it
if you want me, show it
if you need me, prove it
if you love me, say it
if you trust me, do it
if you want me, show it
if you need me, prove it


you see now actions speak louder than words
so don't just say things that i've already heard
don't want your body without your soul
i don't want a love who will come here and go


you will not hurt my pride
if right now you decide
that you are not ready to settle down
but if you want my heart
then it's time that you start
to act like you're mine, in the light and the dark


if you love me, say it
if you trust me, do it
if you want me, show it
if you need me, prove it

What Kind Of Man Would I Be|Mint Condition|r&b|"
you know
we can't do this
we just can't
listen


you say you feel disenchanted
cause lately he takes you for granted
still faithful and true you remained and
to hurt so have i
you pour out your heart and i listen
and we catch a vibe reminiscing
temptations so strong not to mention
the yearning inside


but what kind of man would i be
if i lived unfaithfully
and what kind of girl would you be
if you did the same
cause i don't wanna see her cry
and you don't need a reason to lie
cause if we laid down tonight
it won't justify throwing love aside


this feeling is strong and we know it
but we gotta see past the moment
there's too much to lose if we blow it
this is no lie
still, here we are both together
with promises made that we never
yet feeling it now more than ever
i can't deny


but what kind of man would i be
if i lived unfaithfully
and what kind of girl would you be
if you did the same
cause i don't wanna see her cry
and you don't need a reason to lie
cause if we laid down tonight
it won't justify throwing love aside


here we are all alone
but somehow we've got to stay strong


but what kind of man would i be
if i lived unfaithfully
and what kind of girl would you be
if you did the same
cause i don't wanna see her cry
and you don't need a reason to lie
cause if we laid down tonight
it won't justify throwing love aside


yeahhh


makes me wanna say oh
just gotta say oh
she makes me wanna say oh
just gotta say oh
but what kind of man would i be, oh i can't be unfaithful

who is that texting your phone?
just a friend, just a friend (okay)

how would you like it if i do the things you do?
put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
i'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
give another guy everything that belongs to you

don't get it twisted i can play this game too
how would you like it if i did the same to you (same to you)


you don't like it

why you be out here playing the victim
when i am the one who been cryin'
why dish it out but can't take it
i want revenge, i can't fake it
wanna see the look on your face
when i drop my clothes and i get naked
not for you, but for him
now tell me player, how does that make you feel?
how could you play me when the love i gave was real
i even took you back and you still had no chill


boy you ain't gone ever learn

All I Want Is You|Miguel featuring J.Cole|r&b|"20. better off dead - flatbush zombies
the entirety of flatbush zombies’ sophomore effort betteroffdead can be summed up by one track: “death 2”. it represents a manifesto of sorts for the trio, splattering a terrifying sample of an interview with charles manson and some violently drugged-out lyrics onto producer erick arc elliot’s trademark grim landscape. on the surface, the zombies have barely progressed from being the intentionally-insane jack-of-all-drugs zombie-obsessed members of the burgeoning hip-hop force the beast coast. however, once you enter into their world on betteroffdead, they quickly whisk you away into a hazy realm of ethereal beats, harshly smooth flows, and a plethora of topics the two mcs trade bars on. released on 9/11/13 at 9:11 p.m., the political content immediately struck as more evolved and polished. the 19 tracks seem to warp into a continuous stream that allows each song to stand out on its own while not deviating from the general concept of the tape. in this sense alone, the group reveals a massive amount of musical growth since their eccentric debut mixtape d.r.u.g.s..
19. the gifted - wale
a wale album wouldn’t be a wale album without criticism, controversy, and, well, haters. about six months after dropping folarin, wale blessed us with his third studio album entitled, the gifted. the album had already received reproach when the artwork for the album cover dropped, but wale had a response for the nonbelievers. the gifted is a classic “dmv-style” record with stories that touch on drugs, sex, and growing up in an environment with a “crabs in the bucket” mentality. it contains music as diverse as its features with club bangers like “clappers” to more profound songs like “black heroes”. the musicality of the records make it clear that wale’s focus was on big production this time around. wale might feel he didn’t get proper recognition, but the rg community certainly was feeling him!
18. therapy - tech n9ne
therapy is an ep with 11 tracks, 4 of which are skits, but as tech n9ne assures you early on, it is not something he threw together and put out carelessly. instead, the ep has a very distinct feel, with tech spitting and doing a bit of singing over what amounts to rock and roll tracks produced by ross robinson and seven. tech tackles a range of emotions with topics like the failings of the school system to relationship issues. when paired with the unorthodox production, it is strangely effective in getting its message across. by the end of therapy, most listeners are going to be wishing the ep was longer
17. run the jewels - el-p & killer mike
el-p and killer mike both dropped extremely dope albums in 2012, so when they decided to come together as run the jewels, and release an album this year, everyone was rubbing their hands together like birdman. el-p’s trademark production lays the framework for the two rappers to go off, and they do, spitting with the intent to outdo each other and everyone else in rap on each song. the result is an album that doesn’t mess around with fancy hooks or excessive features. instead, it’s rappers simply rapping, and doing so extremely well.  did i mention they released this album for free?
16. knock madness - hopsin





over 3 years after his first independently-released album raw, hopsin presents us with another indie release knock madness. the album featurs fellow funk volume members including swizzz, jarren benton, and dizzy wright, along with fellow independent artist and strange music mogul tech n9ne. what’s more is production was handled entirely by hopsin himself. momentum for the album was fueled by aggressive releases like “hop is back”. during the weeks leading up to the release date for the album, hopsin appeared to go through a rough patch with all the pressure of releasing another album and touring at the same time, leading to somewhat of a breakdown via his twitter. however, hopsin bounced back, released the album on november 24th, and received fairly positive reviews. #stillmovin’
15. summer knights - joey bada$$
summer knights is the follow-up to joey badass’ acclaimed debut mixtape, 1999.  the tape featurs his fellow pro era members and boasts strong production from dj premier, the alchemist, and mf doom.  much like 1999, the tape exudes a ‘90s feel. however, summer knights carries a much darker tone, perhaps because of the passing of joey's close friend, capital steez (who is honored on the penultimate track, “#longlivesteelo”). the tape had several standout tracks, including his debut single, “unorthodox”, which was laden with wordplay. overall, joey produced another solid mixtape effort, solidifying himself as one of hip-hop’s most promising mcs
14. long.live.a$ap - a$ap rocky





dropping at the top of the year is always a risk; you never know what’s coming, who’s coming, or how your major label debut is going to hold up against the competition. however, for lord flacco, that ain’t a problem. leaking a full month before the release date saw the industry condemn rocky’s album to poor sales, yet to much surprise, he moved 139,000 units in the first week. the lp spawned multiple hits, most notably the drake, 2 chainz, and kendrick assisted ”fuckin’ problems”, earning rocky 2x platinum status and almost 5 million views on rap genius. the other most notable song ”1 train” featured a host of young mc’s, with the cypher starting the 6 minute song trend of 2013.  long.live.a$ap functioned as necessary: it spawned multiple hits, presented rocky to the masses, and cemented the asap mob as new york’s newest clique to watch in the coming years
13. innanetape - vic mensa

innanetape is a trip through your emotions guided by a narrator who seems to be mature beyond his years. from infectiously feel-good songs like ""orange soda"" and ""lovely day"" to introspective and serious ones like ""holy, holy"" and ""fear & doubt,"" vic is always honest in detailing his observations and experiences. he hops on and off the beat at will, effortlessly delivering bars from the humorously playful to the intensely sobering. vic’s nimble performance is underscored by production ably spearheaded by the likes of cam, peter cottontale, and vic himself
12. old - danny brown
they want that old danny brown. xxx was a complicated, dark album about life in detroit where danny brown’s voice and frame of mind could change wildly depending on the song. there was also a bunch of sex and drugs. old, its follow up, grapples with the success and misconceptions of xxx--”the return of the gangster/ fuck a hipster squeeze a trigger/you got me fucked up i'm a hood ass nigga.” old front loads songs about drug addiction and poverty on side a, while saving the festival ready bangers for side b. it's an interesting conceptual approach that rewards multiple listens, whether your favorite track is the gritty “25 bucks” or the druggy, energetic “dip.” danny brown has matured in a way that gives his music layers while not compromising his unmistakable pace, personality and provocation
11. magna carta holy grail - jay z





on 2011’s watch the throne, jay z set out to ask a very serious question, and one that he was uniquely well-equipped to weigh in on: what does it mean to finally have a black elite class in america, given the country’s long and sordid history of white supremacy, and of black resistance?  while wtt attempted to delve into that question on a macro level, this year’s magna carta holy grail looked at the same issues, but from a micro, personal perspective

the album’s repeated evocations of ali are telling.  as with the champ, jay no longer has the option of going out in a blaze of glory like his pal chris wallace, whose epic public funeral he evokes on “f.u.t.w.”  instead, he’s determined to set up a legacy -- to turn the “new blacks with new stacks” into a lasting societal force.  and if he’s as successful with that as he was this year in talking about it, we’ll be in pretty good shape. #factsonly
10. wolf - tyler the creator

tyler told us wolf was coming all the way back in 2010 and on april 2nd, the of general unleashed his 3rd full length body of work, complete with 3 album covers, socks, and a track with his idol pharrell. presenting a heavy conceptual storyline set in camp flog gnaw, the album takes you through the trials and tribulations of the main characters: tyler, wolf, sam, and salem, weaving intricately between the narratives we’ve heard on his albums prior. serving as a prequel to those projects, wolf  is not only a conceptual masterpiece, but an evolution of tyler’s music. the production took an alternate direction and featured a different set of sonics. with heavy influence from the neptunes, tyler crafts around the drums like a seasoned vet. standout tracks include “ifhy”, “treehome95”, “48”, and “rusty”, and with dope features from his odd future brethren, “wolf” was one of the years best.  the album, story and sonics resonate despite a dozen releases that came after it, and luckily we still have a movie to look forward to
9. watching movies with the sound off - mac miller





watching movies with the sound off affords the listener a rare glimpse into the maturation process of both a man and an artist. mac's exploration of different philosophies and perspectives is expressed through denser rhyme schemes and more diversified features than ever before. the introspection on tracks like ""remember"" and ""objects in the mirror"" evokes emotion from the audience, while the dichotomy of playfulness and surrealism on tracks like ""avian"" effectively captures the album's essence as a whole. the album's airy production matches mac's experimental tone, packaging his best release to date
8. born sinner - j.cole





this album is light years ahead of j. cole’s previous album release, 2010’s cole world, and shows a unique style and voice that wasn’t there before.this album may be just enough to liberate cole from the stigma of being “diet drizzy” as music reviewer bigghost once called him, because it also has a diversity in tone, from morose confessional tracks like “let nas down” to r&b rave-ups like “power trip”, which was assisted in part by another up and comer, miguel. cole finally came out from under the shadow of jay z and “work out”, to deliver a solid album
7. doris - earl sweatshirt

earl sweatshirt came through looking extra clean with the release of doris in august of this year. thebe’s album debuted at number 5 on the billboard 200 with 49,000 sales in the us. with that fuckin’ flow that so belittles men, it’s understandable that this album got a ton of love on rap genius. doris has over 2.6 million combined pageviews, most of which are on standout tracks “hive”, “chum”, and “whoa”. the album includes production from rza, the neptunes, and tyler the creator. technically and sonically this album is truly a masterpiece; earl killed them all with this one
6. my name is my name - pusha t





after the countless rumors and delays, the hip-hop world was questioning if terrance thronton could really compete with the major players minus older brother gene. king push put the gossip to rest on october 7 when the 36 year old released his highly anticipated debut solo project; my name is my name. without an ideal rollout, push relied on the streets and internet to hype the record. raw, dark and sometimes described as “disgusting” records hit the hood; ”numbers on the boards”, “nosetaliga” and “suicide” were 2013’s ghetto anthems. the g.o.o.d music golden child was also popular on rap genius, with 2 songs featuring in the top 10 of our best 100 songs as well as managing to find a spot on our mvp list; taking the #10 spot. my name is my name captured the essence of hip hop with it’s standout production and menacing wordplay - will it go down as a classic debut? only time will tell
5. nothing was the same - drake





drizzy shook up the rap game when he dropped one of the most anticipated albums of the year, nothing was the same, the follow up of his highly successful sophomore lp, take care. the album featured jay z, jhené aiko, 2 chainz, and others. production was mainly handled by his right-hand man, noah ""40"" shebib, with help from additional ovo sound producers. propelled by the successes of the smash singles “started from the bottom” and “hold on, we're going home”, drake debuted #1 on the us billboard 200 chart, moving an impressive 658,000 units in the first week and was certified platinum just one month after its release. with over a combined 15.6 million pageviews on rap genius, it's clear nwts was one of the most popular and acclaimed albums of 2013
4. because the internet - childish gambino





it seems ludicrous that anyone would give up the relative security of a tv paycheck to perfect and promote their musical projects (amongst other things). yet that is what childish gambino did, and his sacrifice bore great fruit in because the internet. the album showcases greatly improved hooks and flow whilst maintaining the stellar production of the d-money/ludwig görransson team (who btw doesn’t feel the need to stick his name alongside gambino’s). this lp expands on many of the themes gambino has previously addressed: emotionally dissatisfying relationships, questions of identity/authenticity; but they’re framed within the new contexts of his life, namely the technologies (the internet and other new media) that have arguably propelled him to musical stardom. to that end he wrote an 76-page screenplay and filmed a 25-minute prequel short (clapping for the wrong reasons) and uploaded them to the web to accompany the album. people might still argue that gambino’s lyrics aren’t “serious” enough, but no one can argue that he doesn’t take his work seriously, and it shows
3. marshall mathers lp 2 - eminem





there was a lot riding on this album. a flop would transform em from a respected veteran to a 41-year-old sellout that still has to dye his hair blond to move records. not to mention the fact that its title would draw natural comparisons to the original marshall mathers lp, one of the most brilliant, successful, and controversial albums of all time. luckily, instead of trying to recreate the original, em simply revisited it. the themes of the two are still similar: family issues, trouble dealing with fame, and the difference between his alter-egos. but the sequel showed sides of em that we’ve never seen and did enough to differentiate itself from the original to merit its title. critics praised it as his best work since the eminem show, and standout tracks like “bad guy” and “rap god” prove that the king of controversy still has plenty to say
2. acid rap - chance the rapper





acid rap finds chance coming into his own lane and gaining a huge audience for it. he is high-energy and on the ball from the very start, only slowing down to vividly paint a picture of chicago gun violence and remind us what love is. despite categorically bomb features from the likes of bronsolino, soulo, gambino, twista, and vic mensa, chance’s now-signature sportive flow holds the attention of the listener throughout the whole mixtape. this set of songs effectively blurs the line between mixtape and album, and has led chance across the country and onto the cover of multiple magazines
1. yeezus - kanye west




kanye’s 6th solo album, yeezus, stunned many due to ye’s all-around unique creation and promotion of the project. the whole concept around this creative masterpiece was minimalism, and kanye definitely hit the nail on the head, starting with the promotion of the album. the only big promotional tools used by ye were posters and the infamous projections of the 4th song on the album, “new slaves.” other than these two methods, there was not much outside promotion to really put a light on the potentially culture-changing album delivered in yeezus. speaking of minimalism, ye really took it to the next level, by only releasing 10 songs and having rick rubin come in to minimize (yes, minimize) the album

content-wise, the 10 tracks that were presented were all so, so, sooooo good. beginning with the bombastic and earth-shattering “on sight”, kanye truly proved that he “does not give a fuck” and is willing to do whatever in order to make sure that he gets the best sound possible. that best sound? it ranges from the soulful flashback that is “bound 2” to the banging “blood on the leaves” to the outstandingly synthesized “i am a god.” in addition to the production, which was handled by a terrific team of producers, kanye lyrically brings a lot to the table, rapping about everything from hedi slimane to metaphorical religious journeys up mountains to having sex with kim kardashian

in all, the process, creation, and content delivered in yeezus was revolutionary in multiple aspects. it's no wonder it made the #1 spot on our list of top 20 rap albums!"

You Got Me|The Roots|r&b|"
if you were worried 'bout where
i been or who i saw or
what club i went to with my homies
baby, don't worry
you know that you got me


somebody told me that this planet was small
we used to live in the same building
on the same floor, and never met before
until i'm overseas on tour, and peeped this ethiopian queen from philly taking classes abroad
she studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
she said she loved my show in paris at elysee montmartre
and that i stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
we knew from the start that things fall apart
and tend to shatter, she like, ""that shit don't matter.""
when i get home, get at her
through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
shit, you think not, think the thought went home and forgot?
time passed, we back in philly, now she up in my spot
telling me the things i'm telling her is making her hot
starting building with her constantly round-the-clock
now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me…


if you were worried 'bout where
i been or who i saw or
what club i went to with my homies
baby, don't worry
you know that you got me


yo, i'm the type that's always catching a flight
and sometimes i gotta be out at the height of the night
and that's when she flip
and get on some old… another lonely night
seem like i'm on the side, you only loving your mic
i know you gotta get that paper
daddy, keep that shit tight
but, yo, i need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
while politicking with my sister from new york city
she said she know this ball player
and he think i'm pretty—psych, i'm playin', boo
you know it's just with you i'm staying, boo
and when cats be poppin' game
i don't hear what they sayin', boo
when you out there in the world i'm still your girl
with all my classes i don't have the time for life's thrills
so when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme
and don't be listening to your homies
they be leadin' you blind
yeah, so what you saying, i can trust you?
is you crazy?! you my king for real
but sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt


if you were worried 'bout where
i been or who i saw or
what club i went to with my homies
baby, don't worry
you know that you got me


that snake could be that chick
and that rat could be that cool cat
that's whispering, ""she trying to play you for the fool, black.""
if something's on your chest, then let it be known
see, i'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
and on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
that people bite back and fracture what's intact
and they'll forever be, i ain't on some ""oh, i'm a celebrity!""
i deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
i've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends
that's exactly the point where their whole world ends
lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…


if you were worried 'bout where
i been or who i saw or
what club i went to with my homies
baby, don't worry

U + Me (Love Lesson)|Mary J. Blige|r&b|"
must've been crazy to think that you loved me
i saw all the signs but i just couldn't say nothing
i did the time across the line for you
'cause i can't see myself with nobody else but you
tell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted
should've been the one to hold me when i got lonely
'cause every time i think of the lies you told to me
make it easy for me to leave


you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned
you plus me was a love lesson

oh, i was ridin' wherever you going
at times, i wanted to leave, but didn't wanna be lonely
can't deny the fact you were my one and only
love that i would do, only love i knew
and now i gotta turn my back 'cause you didn't realize that, boy
this was a real thing
and i just can't deny the fact we don't belong together
guess it ain't the real thing


you plus me was a love lesson

gotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times
gotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now
there's so much to learn
when we trust the love that's deep in us
then love will return (yes, it will)
boy this thing was, a love lesson


you plus me was a love lesson
in too deep without imperfection
not always good, but i stayed on my feet
you had me, should've never questioned

Bust Your Windows|Jazmine Sullivan|r&b|"i bust the windows out your car
and, no, it didn't mend my broken heart
i'll probably always have these ugly scars
but right now, i don't care about that part

i bust the windows out your car
after i saw you laying next to her
i didn't wanna, but i took my turn
i'm glad i did it cause you had to learn

i must admit it helped a little bit
to think of how you'd feel when you saw it
i didn't know that i had that much strength
but i'm glad you see what happens when


you see you can't just play with people's feelings
tell them you love them and don't mean it
you'll probably say that it was juvenile
but i think that i deserve to smile

i bust the windows out your car
you know i did it cause i left my mark
wrote my initials with a crowbar
and then i drove off into the dark

i bust the windows out your car
you should feel lucky that was all i did
after 5 whole years of this bullshit
gave you all of me and you played with it

i must admit it helped a little bit
to think of how you'd feel when you saw it
i didn't know that i had that much strength
but i'm glad you see what happens when

you see you can't just play with people's feelings
tell them you love them and don't mean it
you probably say that it was juvenile
but i think that i deserve to smile

i bust the windows out your car
but it don't compare to my broken heart
you could never feel how i felt that day
until it happens, baby, you don't know pain

oh, yeah, i did it. you should know it
i ain't sorry. you deserved it
after what you did to me
you deserved it. i ain't sorry no, no

you broke my heart, so i broke your car
you caused me pain, so i did the same
even though what you did to me was much worse
i had to do something to make you hurt

oh, but why am i still crying?
why am i the one who's still crying?
oh, oh, you really hurt me, baby

Pink + White|Frank Ocean|r&b|"
yeah, yeah (woo!)
yeah, yeah, yeah


that's the way every day goes
every time we've no control
if the sky is pink and white
if the ground is black and yellow
it's the same way you showed me
nod my head, don't close my eyes
halfway on a slow move
it's the same way you showed me
if you could fly, then you'd feel south
up north's getting cold soon
the way it is, we're on land
still i'm someone to hold true
keep you cool when it's still alive
won't let you down when it's all ruin


just the same way you showed me, showed me
you showed me love
glory from above
regard, my dear
it's all downhill from here


in the wake of a hurricane
dark skin of a summer shade
nosedive into flood lines
tall tower of milk crates
it's the same way you showed me
cannonball off the porch side
older kids trying off the roof
just the same way you showed me (you showed)
if you could die and come back to life
up for air from the swimming pool
you'd kneel down to the dry land
kiss the earth that birthed you
gave you tools just to stay alive
and make it out when the sun is ruined


that's the same way you showed me, showed me
you showed me love
glory from above
regard, my dear
it's all downhill from here


remember life, remember how it was
climb trees, michael jackson, it all ends here
say what up to matthew, to shoob
say what up to danny
say what up to life immortality
bending up my nikes
running out the melpomene, nicotine
stealing granny cigs (take it easy)

honies in the street say, ""monty, yo, we made it!""
it feels so good in my hood tonight
the summertime skirts and the guys in kani
all the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by

so tip up your cup and throw your hands up
and let me hear the party say

you see the hood's been good to me
ever since i was a lower-case g
but now i'm a big g

once upon a time in '94
montell made no money and life sure was slow

he came up to monty, this is what he said
you and oji are gonna make some cash
sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

Unravel Me|Sabrina Claudio|r&b|"
it's something in the sun or the air
it's making me want to run away from here
i know that you want me to stay with you, but no
so i'll keep on making excuses about the sun, the earth, the rays


our days are numbered
wired, and i'm tired of it
i know you're trying, but you'll never unravel me


unravel me, unravel
unravel me, unravel


it's something about the season that we're in
(we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in)
that's making me think that we're not supposed to do this
i know that you're trying to understand, but you can't
'cause i keep on making excuses about the fall, the rise


and how my mind is ruptured
wired, and i'm tired of it
i know you're trying
but you'll never unravel me


unravel me, unravel
unravel me, unravel
unravel me, unravel
unravel me, unravel

jackie's mom: jackie lynn, just use your contact lenses. you need the prescription.
jackie: no, mom. they turn my eyes blue. and that's me giving in to white culture, with their drone wars and lip-sync battles.
jackie's mom: well, then order plain ones. yesterday i saw you try to milk a male buffalo.
jackie: (scoffs) whatever, mom. it worked. i put it in the fridge.
there's a pause, jackie's mom looks at her coffee and edges it away from her
jackie's dad: and when are you gonna give back that police car you showed up in? there's a raccoon living in it.
jackie: oh, he's not living in it. he got stuck in the back because of the prisoner locks and he died of heatstroke.

cutto: kimmy and vonda eating ice cream on a park bench

kimmy: look, the reason i called is 'cause titus (kimmy notices ice cream melting onto her hand) dang!
vonda: lick it. what's your deal? you're like a cartoon person. honestly, i don't even really want money from ronald. i just want him to apologize. this might make me seem like a fool, kimmy, but we loved each other. i know we did.

cutto: flashback of vonda and titus kissing

vonda: i mean, i knew he liked men...
announcer on tv: with tim meadows (titus looks at the tv while still kissing vonda)
vonda:...but he knew i liked skinny white boys.
announcer on tv: david spade.(vonda looks at tv while still kissing titus)
announcer on tv: musical guest, hootie & the blowfish.(both look at the tv while still kissing)

cutto: present time, park bench

vonda: neither of us could live our truth in chickasaw county. so i thought, ""we gonna live our lie together. but that night, our wedding night, when they realized ronald ran away, every one of his five aunties that raised him had a heart attack.

cutto: flashback to the wedding with five women collapsing behind vonda

vonda:and he left me on that dance floor, alone, with no choice but to robocop my way to the car.

(vonda begins to robocop)

cutto: present time, park bench

kimmy: that's terrible.
vonda: ronald wilkerson would have never done that to me. that was your friend titus. i don't even recognize that man.
kimmy: for what it's worth, he did get cheek implants that slipped.
vonda: you're the new me. look at you right now, trying to clean up his mess. but once there's nothing else that titus can get from you, he will leave you with an unpaid dental bill and a refrigerator full of spoiled wedding shrimp. watch your back. and wash your arm, baby.
kimmy looks at her arm which is now covered in melted ice cream
kimmy: oh.(phone chimes)

cutto: lawyer's office

titus: why are you late? why did mr. lawyer call an emergency meeting? did vonda do this?
kimmy: titus, the way you bailed on her, have you ever done that to anyone else?
titus: a sam goody credit card. my college football scholarship. my cousin who got handsomer than me stupid darius. also, i'm not gonna pay this lawyer.

vonda and the lawyer enter the room

lawyer: well, i've got good news, and i've got bad news. the bad news is, instagram canceled my account due to lack of interest. the good news is that in 2008, ronald wilkerson was declared legally dead by this woman! (dramatic gasp) he'd been missing ten years.
vonda: with his diet, i was being generous.
lawyer: sick burn. however, you did collect mr. wilkerson's social security earnings, as well as the money from an insurance policy he took out on his legs.
titus: i was inspired by mary hart to insure my assets at that time.
lawyer: so because ""ronald wilkerson"" is dead, ms. brooks, you can't sue him. as a matter of fact, you may owe him about $500.
vonda: what?
titus: what?
lawyer: well, i think we're done here.
titus: boom, bitch! bye! i am not the one. see you in the funny papers, country mouse. you better call jennifer love hewitt and phil rizzuto, because you owe a ghost money. okay? (makes a dramatic, victorious exit) unh, unh, unh! unh!
vonda: good luck with that, kimmy.

cutto: kimmy and lillian walking on the street

kimmy: lillian, do you think titus would ever do to us what he did to vonda?
lillian: chew up crackers and pretend to throw up on us after prom to get out of sex? i could see it happening, yes. but who cares? we're going out. we're gonna get more phone numbers than the nsa.
political!
kimmy: yes! right. let's go life. (pauses in front of a store) oh, wait, i need something in here.

cutto: inside the store

lillian: oh, i'll be in intimates.
kimmy: hi, i need a box of silverfish poison.
store owner: no, sir, ma'am. that guy is buy the last one.(points at dong)
dong: kimmy?
kimmy: dong. you look well.
dong: it's so nice to see you.
kimmy: i'd like that. how is your wife? still sonja?
dong: yes, thank you. sonja and i are having people over for brunch tomorrow, and the silverfish ate all our towels.
kimmy: wow, your english is getting really well.
dong: thank you. i didn't have you to help me anymore, so i started watching a lot of...(in a whiny voice) ""keeping up with the kardashians"".
kimmy: well, it's working.
dong: (in a whiny voice) aw, you're sweet.

lillian enters from behind dong

lillian: dong? (gasps) my god. you should come roller-skating with us.
kimmy: what? lillian, no. everyone knows you can't skate as a threesies.
lillian: shut up. as luck would have it, we'll be a foursome. i just ran into my old flame, bobby.

bobby enters from down one of the shopping aisles

bobby: okay, hi-hi.
kimmy: i think dong probably needs to get back to his wife, lillian.
dong: actually, sonja's at her bikram hot yogurt class, and i do have to stay out of the apartment for seven hours after i set off the silverfish bomb. (in whiney voice again) so, yeah, that sounds amazing.
lillian: well, perfect. we'll be a foursome. come on. (drags dong and kimmy out of store)
bobby: i want this. like you do. you're right. i'm wrong.

cutto: jackie dancing in a cornfield

jackie: (singing) you can feel it it protects us boogie oogie, oogie, oogie pray to the corn god he's corn-lectric boogie oogie, oogie, oogie

kid on bike enters

kid on bike: why are you doing the (in sioux) white idiot (in english) wedding dance (in sioux) white idiot.
jackie:(stops dancing) oh, my corn god.

cutto: rollerskating rink. kimmy and dong are rollerskating somewhat awkwardly.

kimmy: so a brunch, huh? that's frasier fancy.
dong: it's just to impress the immigration officer. sonja and i have to be believably married for two years, and then i'll be a real american and get divorced.
kimmy: let's talk about something else.
dong: (in whiney voice) mm, i think khloe is probably the smartest of the kardashians 'cause, like, she makes the most sense.
kimmy: i've never seen their show. i just know that kim is a butt star and married a rapper who hates college. and kourtney finally ended her destructive relationship with scott. meanwhile, kim's firing back at the haters with a naked pregnancy selfie. wait, how do i know all this? i saw it on the regular news. duh.(chuckles)
dong: your eyes look so pretty in the disco lights.
kimmy: what?

lillian enters on roller skates

lillian: oh, looking good, red.

kimmy steps off to talk to lillian while dong continues skating

kimmy: lillian, how is this helping me? i need to find a new boyfriend. dong is married.
lillian: yeah, but it's just a sham marriage like titus and vonda or abe lincoln, mary todd. political!
kimmy: it doesn't matter. some things are just wrong, like kissing a married person or tracing something and saying you drew it.
lillian: kimmy we have a wonderful thing here in new york called moral relativism. where you're from, in the midwest, people say, ""i'll never cheat on my wife,"" or, ""i'm not gay. i'm a wrestling coach."" and then one day, boof, the wheels come off, they do it all in one weekend, and drop dead. here, we say, ""eh, so i kissed a priest in a leather bar. who am i hurting?""
kimmy: no, i don't like that.

bobby enters, not wearing roller skates and lugging a briefcase

bobby: what a disaster. if you want the sandwich, take the sandwich, of course. okay, bye-bye.

bobby exits

lillian: right, wrong, ehh.

lillian pushes kimmy into dong who re-enters the scene, they share an accidental hug while clinging on each other, trying not to both fall down

kimmy: ooh. oh.
dong: ooh. you have so many more bones than sonja.
kimmy: i used to eat a lot of powdered milk. okay, bye. have a nice life.

cutto: lillian and bobby who are dancing. scene then changes to jackie's parent's house as jackie walks in, slamming the door behind her

jackie: i can't believe you lied to me.
jackie's mom: i'm sorry, but we don't know what to do with you anymore.
jackie's dad: two silo explosions? how?
jackie: if i knew, it wouldn't have happened twice.
jackie's mom: jackie lynn, our town can't afford this. we have so little money as it is.
jackie's dad: the elders are having a sweat tonight to pray for a resolution to the jackie lynn situation.
jackie: i want to go.
jackie's dad: no.
jackie's mom: stay away from the sweat lodge. jackie lynn, you belong to another tribe now.
jackie: what does that mean?
jackie's dad: maybe you should go back to new york.
jackie: well okay. if that's the way you feel. (grabs dream catcher and starts brandishing it like a gun) pew-pew! pew!
jackie's mom: what are you doing?
jackie: i'm shooting nightmares at you.
jackie's mom: that's not how it works.
jackie: oh.
jackie's dad: an ihanbla gmunka. it symbolizes connectivity. if even one thread breaks, everything falls apart. it's like you, jackie lynn. you need to mend your web. but your connections are back in manhattan.
jackie: nothing i ever do is good enough for this family. i feel like rob kardashian!
jackie's mom: the sock designer? why do i know that?

jackie storms out of the house, walks towards the stolen police car, and enters the back seat.

jackie: driver, just go around the block a few times. oh. right. (tries to open door, it's locked) no.(tries other side) no. no. the prisoner locks. it's like a sweat lodge in here. help! help! (in sioux) coffee! coffee! white idiot! white idiot.

cutto: titus eating pizza in his apartment.

titus: (singing) pizza party for one divorced, dead, and having some fun pizza party for one.(kimmy enters) i don't have pizza. what's wrong, kim blake nelson?
kimmy: i don't know, titus. what is wrong? and what's right? and what's just ehh?
titus: i find that life is mostly gray areas, especially the parts i can't reach with moisturizer.
kimmy: uh-huh. is that why you thought it was okay to be so mean to vonda?
titus: i don't know what you're referring to, because in the movie i saw, i was a hero scoring a legal victory for young run-a-gays everywhere.
kimmy: you couldn't even apologize to her.
titus: there are three things titus andromedon does not do: apologies, drag, and calculus.
kimmy: i'm beginning to think maybe you were a better person back when you were ronald wilkerson.
titus: well, we'll never know 'cause ronald wilkerson's dead.
kimmy: oh, you are just mr. sassafras jeans today.
titus: that's a dumb name for how fierce i'm being right now.
kimmy: i want to talk to ronald.
titus: what?
kimmy: he was good and nice, and he's still in there somewhere.
titus: i have many past lives inside me.
kimmy: i want to talk to ronald.
titus: no!
kimmy: titus andromedon, let me speak to ronald!
titus: ronald no want to talk, please. (in a different tone) that was murasaki. i'll explain her later.
kimmy: ronald, you loved vonda.
titus: leave us alone, lassie! ooh, who was that? ow.

kimmy grabs titus by the ear

titus: aah! (as ronald) i-i-i sure didn't want to hurt vonda jeanne. i was scared to face her. what if she wouldn't accept my apology? (as titus) shut up, ronald, you nerd.
kimmy: see? i knew it. you need to embrace your ronald, titus.
titus: for why?
kimmy: for me. i'm your vonda now. how do i know you won't just pack up and run away from me?
titus: because i probably won't. now, can i please eat my ham and clam pizza in peace?
kimmy: that's wrong. those toppings are wrong.
titus: i will agree with you in 20 minutes.
kimmy: but it doesn't matter, does it? 'cause this is new york, where everyone's moral relatives. just order a deep-dish ham/clam, and some sicko will make it for you.
titus: i'll have you know i didn't order these. i found them.
kimmy: am i the only person in this city who doesn't just do whatevs whenevs? well, fudge that sugar. fudge it to heck, where a demon with a thousand wee-wees fudges it forever! i'm crashing dong's brunch!

kimmy storms out as titus takes his first bite of pizza.

cutto: jackie stuck in her stolen police car

jackie: i'm sweating like an indian in here. it's okay. i can say that. i can say that.

jackie begins to hallucinate her father and mother as well as the kid on the bike and ""corn god""

jackie's dad: jackie lynn, the hoop symbolizes unity.
jackie: i'm visioning.
jackie's mom: we have so little money as it is.
kid on bike: your house is that way, dummy.
corn god: you belong to a different tribe now. boogie oogie, oogie.
jackie: corn god. you are corn-lectric.
jackie's mom: just use your contacts.
jackie's dad: your connections are back in manhattan.in manhattan

jackie then hallucinates the washington redskins' logo

washington redskin's logo: how am i still a thing?
kid on bike: connections.
jackie's dad: back in manhattan.
jackie's mom: lacrosse is our thing.
jackie's dad: contacts, contacts, contacts.
jackie: i know what i have to do!

jackie begins kicking the window.

cutto: kimmy walks into sonja's home which is filled with sonja's friends as well as an immigration officer

sonja: kimmy! it's sonja from ged class? also, the cartoon anastasia is about me.
kimmy: of course. sonja. hello.
sonja: kimmy is our best friend.
immigration officer: oh. were you at their wedding?
kimmy: well, i wanted to be, but these two lovebirds eloped.
sonja: i'm not a bird today.
dong: kimmy. what are you-
kimmy: listen. i need to talk to you in private.
cutto: a small bathroom where dong and kimmy can talk alone
dong: what are you doing here?
kimmy: lookit, we had fun last night, right?
dong: yeah. but then things got weird. (in whiney voice) like when kourtney squirted her breast milk on kim's psoriasis.
kimmy: why do i know about that? here's the thing: there are gray areas in life.
dong: sonja's is enormous.
kimmy: look, i know we both want to do the right thing, but i also can't wait anymore for my life to start.
dong: stop. dead silverfish.
kimmy: i guess the poison's working.
dong: oh, now there's one in your hair. hang on.

dong blows at kimmy's hair while kimmy lets her hair down. they pause for a moment and share a kiss

dong: kimmy, no. we can't do this.
kimmy: look, i'm from the midwest. i believe in the sanctity of marr (sputters in disgust, pulls a silverfish out of her mouth and throws it on the ground) silverfish. but i also want to rub my mouth on your mouth so i don't boof.
dong: stop it. all i want is not to be deported. that's it.
kimmy: what about last night?
dong: last night was a mistake. lillian's hair looked like noodles. i got caught up in it. what if the immigration lady was also super into roller-skating? i could have lost everything.
kimmy: but...
dong: i think you should leave.
kimmy: maybe i'll see you in two years, then?

kimmy leaves.

cutto: titus's apartment where titus is packing

kimmy: titus, what are you doing? wow, so one fight and you're out of here? i've lost my job, my boyfriend, my favorite scrunchie, and now you?
titus: i don't want to talk about this, kimmy. i'm being dramatical.
kimmy: fine. go ahead. just run away from your problems again.

(titus exits)

cutto: titus walking down the street with a briefcase, a boombox, and kimmy following right behind him. they walk towards the train station, making only a brief stop at a cinnabon, all the while, kimmy is lecturing titus

kimmy: you can't keep running away forever, titus. oh, i will keep following you. you know i'm right! your guilt will chase you wherever you go. you can't escape, titus!

cutto: titus and kimmy end up on a train platform, titus approaches the conductor

titus: has the train to biloxi left yet?
conductor: nope. it's running two hours late.

titus spots vonda on the same platform

titus: vonda! wait! wait.
kimmy: vonda? boy, good thing the train was late.
conductor: ha. you think we're a train company? we run late on purpose so people can find each other in romantical fashion. amtrak is for lovers.

kimmy glances around to see couples re-uniting

female amtrak employee: phillip?
male amtrak employee: sheila.

cutto: titus and vonda

titus: vonda i'm sorry. the friendship we had was deep and real, and i should've never abandoned you that way. maybe that's why i never called, 'cause i was afraid to hear how much i had hurt you. but if you'll have me, (takes vonda's hands in his) i'd like to be your friend without benefits.
vonda: i'd like that.
titus: and now, i'd like to pay you back a little of what i owe you.

titus returns the vonda's bridal jacket and hat. he then puts on his old wedding tuxedo jacket and picks up the boombox he carried with him playing ""forever your girl""

titus: ladies and gentlemen, for the first time anywhere, ms. and mr. vonda jeanne brooks and titus ronald wilkerson-andromedon-yoshimura. i'll explain that later.

music plays as vonda and titus dance. bystanders watch and smile. kimmy spots someone who looks like dong.

kimmy: dong. dong.
dong look-alike: racist. karen. hey.

titus and vonda continue to dance. the scene then cuts to lillian and bobby, who are all alone at the roller-skating rink while bobby is playing the ukulele

bobby: (singing) i saw her under the manhattan moon
lillian: (singing) there you were crouching by your rowboat near the central park lagoon
bobby: (singing) your hair was so curly
lillian: your eyes were so black
bobby: (singing) of course it made my heart beat faster
lillian: (singing) bub-bub-bub-bub-bub-bub i knew from the start that you'd break my heart
bobby: and the burping what a disaster
lillian: (singing) i love you
bobby: (singing) even though i'm crazy as a loon. but it's all relative
lillian: yeah, it's live and let live
bobby: sometimes-
together: -under the manhattan moon mm.

something kind of magical in sunlight
flowers uncurl in the garden

it's new like the day i saw your eyes

blossom leaf falls in a slow dance
swaying got me in a trance, so high

we're stuck in a habit

i can't fix you up, oh no
but i still miss you

i'm a fool for trying
but i'm not a fool
the only thing i'm guilty of
is loving you

i can't fix you up, oh no

bump me when you drive by

i hope you know it' alright, i don't mind
shawty, show me your thighs, don't be shy, baby
don’t ride, i’ll lotion you down
or would you rather oil me?
it’s smoother when you ride
fall in my arms girl wake up to me

what's with all our lies again?


but this time i wanna know why, i can't sleep without you to my right
but this time i wanna know why, i can't sleep without you to my right

(harmonizing)


put me to sleep with your voice, babe
don't leave me with the choice, babe
oh please, i don't need no extra love off of you


you can't run outta love
there is nothin' that's too much
can you take me real far? take me the whole way, baby
grab my hands, don't lose faith, i have so much in you
i know when to give you space
'cause i know, know, know that i mess up
got you feelin' like you're 'bout throw a left hook
i throw my hook into your sea while it's floodin' my bed
they have done so much to me, but can't throw off my head
i'm so sorry that you didn't see the love i have
oh well, guess we're better off
only the thoughts confuse all the months
know i was late showin' up to prom, but i show you later
surprise in a box


but this time i wanna know why, i can't sleep without you to my right
but this time i wanna know why, i can't sleep without you to my right

i'm sorry for so much, i'm sorry for so much
i'm sorry for so much, i'm sorry for so much

I Like That|Janelle Monáe|r&b|"
sometimes a mystery, sometimes i'm free
depending on my mood or my attitude
sometimes i wanna roll or stay at home
walking contradiction, guess i’m factual and fiction


a little crazy, little sexy, little cool
little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth
i’m always left of center and that’s right where i belong
i’m the random minor note you hear in major songs


and i like that
i don’t really give a fuck if i was just the only one
who likes that
i never like to follow, follow, i would rather chase the sun
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my

oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
i like that


i don’t care what i look like, but i feel good
better than amazing, and better than i could
told the whole world, i’m the venom and the antidote
take a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat

little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth

we was in math class, third row, i was sitting by you
right before mr. ammond’s class
'cause my mama couldn’t afford new js
polos, thrift store, thrift clothes that was all i knew
do you remember?
uh, i remember when you laughed when i cut my perm off
and you rated me a six
i was like, “damn”
but even back then with the tears in my eyes
i always knew i was the shit

who would be that special one?

London Bridge|TWENTY88|r&b|"
i don't mean to sound hysterical
but baby if you left, baby if you left
it'll be a historical disaster
the kids will sing about it swear the kids will sing about it
like the london bridge is falling down
london bridge, london bridge
like the london bridge is falling down
falling down, falling down


i heard everything must come to an end
well hopefully the end ain't near
or for that matter even clear
the only thing that matters is right here
like the sky, the sun, the waterfalls
i decide when i'm gon' fall
i can't tell you everything i don't know
oh baby i can't tell you everything i don't know


i don't mean to sound hysterical
but baby if you left, baby if you left
it'll be a historical disaster
the kids will sing about it, swear the kids will sing about it
like the london bridge is falling down
london bridge, london bridge
like the london bridge is falling down
falling down, falling down

london bridge is falling down,  that's what it would be without you


i know everything that starts has an end
well hopefully the end ain't near
or for that matter even clear
the only thing that matters is right here
like the stars, the moon, the waterfalls
i decide when i'm gon' fall
i can't tell you everything i don't know
oh baby i can't tell you everything i don't know

falling down, falling down


who would have ever thought that we would fall like london bridges
i know you heard the rumors about me lies and superstitions
heard but ain't choose to listen that’s what made you different
and you keep me driven guess that’s why i could see us going the distance
on nights you text and text and text with no auto corrections
misspelling every other word but i still got the message
and you get carried away like you wearing wedding dresses
i'm sorry i even ever gave you reasons to question
cause you make me feel like the chosen one
eight billion people in the world and i still chose the one
answer this question and i'll answer what you asking me
what happened if we got in an accident died tragically
and next lifetime you remembered and had to come after me
and convinced me that we not meant to be that have to be
and like the defending champs you had to win it all back for me
just got to know how deep is our love actually
what if this was the end and we had to bow out together
i need you to tell me every emotion like now or never
only two times i ever needed you was now and forever
don't know what else to tell you


but i don't mean to sound hysterical
but baby if you left, baby if you left
it'll be a historical disaster
the kids will sing about it, swear the kids will sing about it

Finding My Way Back|Jaheim|r&b|"
lights out, sucker punch, striked out
called it love, we wrote it then i wiped out
two ships just passin' in the night now
offshore, lookin' for a lighthouse


green pill, you said that it was painless
down and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish
funny, you always said hope floats
comprehended but i can't cope
so i...


gotta find my way back, way back
to you, baby
tryin' to find my way back, way back
to you, baby
gotta find my way back, way back
to you, to us, to love, love


man down, my heart's in your hands now
hid your love, another 'x' in the sand now
no clue, no map, damn
so i'm diggin' 'til i end up in japan now


green pill, you said that it was painless
down and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish
funny, you always said hope floats
comprehended but i can't cope
so i gotta...


gotta find my way back, way back
to you, baby
tryin' to find my way back, way back
to you, baby
gotta find my way back, way back
to you, to us, to love, love


we got lost, lines got crossed
and the light turned to static, babe
and then i jumped ship, got caught up in the current
and it carried both of us away
we were so much better
when we were together, baby
and i just can't let you slip away


gotta find my way back, way back
to you, baby
tryin' to find my way back, way back
to you, baby
gotta find my way back, way back

Never Alone|Tori Kelly|r&b|"
mmm, mmm, mmm


in my time i've travelled some roads
a rolling stone
nowhere feels like home
i've seen people come, then they go
life is just a story of some highs and some lows


tell me do you believe in miracles?
i'm standing here before your eyes


i've cried many rivers
i've walked through some pain
i've seen my world crumble
and i've carried the shame
but i know somebody, he calls me his own
i can hear heaven singing out
oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
oh-oh-oh, you're never alone


everybody wants to be king
we put all our hope inside material things
in your light i now understand
that everything i have ain't everything that i am


oh, sometimes i feel like i'm not good enough
but that's when love says you're mine


i've cried many rivers
i've walked through some pain
i've seen my world crumble
and i've carried the shame
but i know somebody, he calls me his own
i can hear heaven singing out
oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
oh-oh-oh, you're never alone


oh, i may have took some time
but now i realize
my imperfections were a part of your plan
and if all things work together in the end
the broken will be beautiful


there's not a hole too deep
that god's love is not deeper still
you've come too far to give up now
let's go!


i've cried many rivers
i've walked through some pain
i've seen my world crumble
and i've carried the shame
but i know somebody, he calls me his own

Long Song Away|Kevin Ross|r&b|"
you always got somewhere to go
your life is filled with revolving doors
it's not a race when it comes to love
unless it's me that you're running from


city girls want it all, but they never can wait
not so fast, you could lose control
i know we live in the now but we can set our own pace
take my hand and we can slow dance, slow dance to the radio


'cause forever's a long, it's a long song away
forever's a long, it's a long song away
so won't you please, please let the record play?
just let the record play


you think that life's gonna pass you by
and you feel that's there is just not enough time, time
why would you stress something that's out of your control, control?
close your eyes and dream that we'll never grow old , old


city girls want it all, but they never can wait
not so fast, you could lose control
i know we live in the now but we can set our own pace
take my hand and we can slow dance, slow dance to the radio


'cause forever's a long, it's a long song away
forever's a long, it's a long song away
so won't you please, please let the record play?
just let the record play


don't turn that down be patient with love
let's keep this in rotation, never let it fail
never let it go


'cause forever's a long, it's a long song away
forever's a long, it's a long song away
so won't you please, please let the record play?
just let the record play"

and now i'm so all alone

Distance|Emily King|r&b|"
hey love time to get up
i think you’ve been sleeping too long
my day started when you were still yawning
one room just ain’t enough
when it’s two folks trying to get along
but it’s hard to leave you alone


oh love is always better
when we take time to get back to who we are
when we are apart
distance makes the heart grow
even when i’m lonely
happy knowing that your love is never far
when we are apart
distance makes the heart


it makes the leaves on the trees fall
it makes the hours in the day long
makes me wanna clear my head
find a little cafe and write the words to a song
and i know that i’m still free
be anywhere that i wanna be
maybe get dressed up
wear something real pretty that you ain’t never seen


oh love is always better
when we take time to get back to who we are
when we are apart
distance makes the heart grow
even when i’m lonely
happy knowing that your love is never far
when we are apart
distance makes the..


when you love it makes the heart
when you trust it makes the heart
when you call it makes it heart
we’re alone, when we’re apart
in the middle of a fight
walk away to make it right
where we go we’re never far
in the light or in the dark
on a plane up in the stars
in a movie or at the bar
home alone or out to tea
look to your heart and think of me
i wanna love you
don’t wanna try to change the pace of your life
we get together we make it good
we get together, ooh..


hey love time to get up

Every Kind Of Way|H.E.R.|r&b|"

for you, i wanna take my time

I'm Goin' Down|Mary J. Blige|r&b|"
time on my hands, since you been away, boy
i ain't got no plans, no no no no
and the sound of the rain, against my windowpane
is slowly, is slowly drivin' me insane, boy


i'm goin' down
i'm goin' down
'cause you ain't around, baby
my whole world's upside down


sleep don't come easy, boy, please believe me
since you been gone, everything's goin' wrong
why'd you have to say, “goodbye”
look what you've done to me
i can't stop these tears from fallin' from my eyes, ooh baby


i'm goin' down
i'm goin' down
'cause you ain't around, baby
my whole world's upside down


ooh, baby love
goin' down, goin' down

ooh i, i


i'm goin' down
i'm goin' down
'cause you ain't around, baby
my whole world's upside down


ooh, goin' down, goin' down
oh, i don't know what to do
if i ever lose you, i'll be goin' down
i said, “i'll be goin' down”
oh, please forgive me, baby
i'm so sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
what did i do wrong?
i said, “what did i do wrong?”
please forgive me, baby, and come on home

and i’m always her regret

and i always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
it goes up and down, it’s just up and down

Nobody's Supposed to Be Here|Deborah Cox|r&b|"
how did you get here? nobody's supposed to be here
i tried that love thing for the last time
my heart says ""no, no."" nobody's supposed to be here
but you came along and changed my mind


i've spent all my life on a search to find
the love who'll stay for eternity
the heaven sent to fulfill my needs
but when i turn around, again, love has knocked me down
my heart got broken, oh it hurts so bad
i'm sad to say love wins again


so i placed my heart under lock and key
to take some time to take care of me
but i turn around and you're standing here




this time i swear i'm through
but, if only you knew how many times i've said those words
then fall again, when will i ever learn?
knowing these tears i cry, this lovely black butterfly
must take a chance, and spread my wings
love can make you do some crazy things

Name on It|Cassandra Lucas|r&b|"bkx:1-95 the council of the gods

meanwhile the palace of all-powerful olympus
was opened wide, and the father of the gods, and king of men,
called a council in his starry house, from whose heights
he gazed at every land, at trojan camp, and latin people.
they took their seats in the hall with doors at east and west,
and he began: ‘great sky-dwellers, why have you changed
your decision, competing now, with such opposing wills?
i commanded italy not to make war on the trojans.
why this conflict, against my orders? what fear
has driven them both to take up arms and incite violence?
the right time for fighting will arrive (don’t bring it on)
when fierce carthage, piercing the alps, will launch
great destruction on the roman strongholds:
then it will be fine to compete in hatred, and ravage things.
now let it alone, and construct a treaty, gladly, as agreed.’
jupiter’s speech was brief as this: but golden venus’s reply was not:
‘o father, eternal judge of men and things
(for who else is there i can make my appeal to now?)
you see how the rutulians exult, how turnus is drawn
by noble horses through the crowd, and, fortunate in war,
rushes on proudly. barred defences no longer protect the trojans:
rather they join battle within the gates, and on the rampart
walls themselves, and the ditches are filled with blood.
aeneas is absent, unaware of this. will you never let the siege
be raised? a second enemy once again menaces and harasses
new-born troy, and again, from aetolian arpi, a diomede rises.
i almost think the wound i had from him still awaits me:
your child merely delays the thrust of that mortal’s weapon.
if the trojans sought italy without your consent, and despite
your divine will, let them expiate the sin: don’t grant them help.
but if they’ve followed the oracles of powers above and below,
why should anyone change your orders now, and forge new destinies?
shall i remind you of their fleet, burned on the shores of eryx?
or the king of the storms and his furious winds roused
from aeolia, or iris sent down from the clouds?
now juno even stirs the dead (the only lot still left to use)
and allecto too, suddenly loosed on the upper world,
runs wild through all the italian cities.
i no longer care about empire. though that was my hope
while fortune was kind. let those you wish to win prevail.
father, if there’s no land your relentless queen will grant the trojans,
i beg, by the smoking ruins of shattered troy, let me bring
ascanius, untouched, from among the weapons: let my grandson live.
aeneas, yes, may be tossed on unknown seas, and go
wherever fortune grants a road: but let me have the power
to protect the child and remove him from the fatal battle.
amathus is mine, high paphos and cythera are mine,
and idalia’s temple: let him ground his weapons there,
and live out inglorious years. command that carthage,
with her great power, crush italy: then there’ll be
no obstacle to the tyrian cities. what was the use in their escaping
the plague of war, fleeing through the heart of argive flames,
enduring the dangers at sea, and in desolate lands,
as long as the trojans seek latium and troy re-born?
wouldn’t it have been better to build on those last embers
of their country, on the soil where troy once stood?
give xanthus and simois back to these unfortunates,
father, i beg you, and let the trojans re-live the course of ilium.’
then royal juno goaded to savage frenzy, cried out:
‘why do you make me shatter my profound silence,
and utter words of suffering to the world?
did any god or man force aeneas to make war
and attack king latinus as an enemy?
he sought italy prompted by the fates (so be it)
impelled by cassandra’s ravings: was he urged by me
to leave the camp, and trust his life to the winds?
to leave the outcome of war, and their defences to a child:
to disturb tuscan good faith, and peaceful tribes?
what goddess, what harsh powers of mine drove him
to harm? where is juno in this, or iris sent from the clouds?
if it’s shameful that the italians surround new-born troy
with flames, and turnus make a stand on his native soil,
he whose ancestor is pilumnus, divine venilia his mother:
what of the trojans with smoking brands using force against the latins,
planting their yoke on others’ fields and driving off their plunder?
deciding whose daughters to marry, and dragging betrothed girls
from their lover’s arms, offering peace with one hand,
but decking their ships with weapons? you can steal
aeneas away from greek hands and grant them fog and empty air
instead of a man, and turn their fleet of ships into as many nymphs:
is it wrong then for me to have given some help to the rutulians?
“aeneas is absent, unaware of this.” let him be absent and unaware.
paphos, idalium, and high cythera are yours? why meddle then
with a city pregnant with wars and fierce hearts?
is it i who try to uproot troy’s fragile state from its base?
is it i? or he who exposed the wretched trojans to the greeks?
what reason was there for europe and asia to rise up
in arms, and dissolve their alliance, through treachery?
did i lead the trojan adulterer to conquer sparta?
did i give him weapons, or foment a war because of his lust?
then, you should have feared for your own: now, too late,
you raise complaints without justice, and provoke useless quarrels.’

bkx:96-117 jupiter leaves the outcome to fate

so juno argued, and all the divinities of heaven murmured
their diverse opinions, as when rising gales murmur in the woods
and roll out their secret humming, warning sailors of coming storms.
then the all-powerful father, who has prime authority over things,
began (the noble hall of the gods fell silent as he spoke,
earth trembled underground, high heaven fell silent,
the zephyrs too were stilled, the sea calmed its placid waters).
‘take my words to heart and fix them there.
since italians and trojans are not allowed to join
in alliance, and your disagreement has no end,
i will draw no distinction between them, trojan or rutulian,
whatever luck each has today, whatever hopes they pursue,
whether the camp’s under siege, because of italy’s fortunes,
or troy’s evil wanderings and unhappy prophecies.
nor will i absolve the rutulians. what each has instigated
shall bring its own suffering and success. jupiter is king of all,
equally: the fates will determine the way.’ he nodded,
swearing it by the waters of his stygian brother,
by the banks that seethe with pitch, and the black chasm
and made all olympus tremble at his nod.
so the speaking ended. jupiter rose from his golden throne,
and the divinities led him to the threshold, among them.

bkx:118-162 aeneas returns from pallantium

meanwhile the rutulians gathered round every gate,
to slaughter the men, and circle the walls with flames,
while aeneas’s army was held inside their stockade,
imprisoned, with no hope of escape. wretchedly they stood
there on the high turrets, and circling the walls, a sparse ring.
asius, son of imbrasus, thymoetes, son of hicetaon,
the two assaraci, and castor with old thymbris were the front rank:
sarpedon’s two brothers, clarus and thaemon, from noble lycia,
were at their side. acmon of lyrnesus, no less huge than his father
clytius, or his brother mnestheus, lifted a giant rock,
no small fragment of a hillside, straining his whole body.
some tried to defend with javelins, some with stones,
hurling fire and fitting arrows to the bow.
see, the trojan boy, himself, in their midst,
venus’s special care, his handsome head uncovered,
sparkling like a jewel set in yellow gold
adorning neck or forehead, gleaming like ivory,
inlaid skilfully in boxwood or orician terebinth:
his milk-white neck, and the circle of soft gold
clasping it, received his flowing hair.
your great-hearted people saw you too ismarus,
dipping reed-shafts in venom, and aiming them
to wound, from a noble lydian house, there where men
till rich fields, that the pactolus waters with gold. there was
mnestheus as well, whom yesterday’s glory, of beating
turnus back from the wall’s embankment, exalted highly,
and capys: from him the name of the campanian city comes.
men were fighting each other in the conflict of bitter war:
while aeneas, by night, was cutting through the waves.
when, on leaving evander and entering the tuscan camp,
he had met the king, announced his name and race,
the help he sought, and that he himself offered,
what forces mezentius was gathering to him,
and the violence in turnus’s heart, and then had warned
how little faith can be placed in human powers,
and had added his entreaties, tarchon, joined forces with him
without delay, and agreed a treaty: then fulfilling their fate
the lydian people took to their ships by divine command,
trusting to a ‘foreign’ leader. aeneas’s vessel took the van,
adorned with phrygian lions below her beak, mount ida
towering above them, a delight to the exiled trojans.
there great aeneas sat and pondered the varying issues
of the war, and pallas sticking close to his left side, asked him
now about the stars, their path through the dark night,
and now about his adventures on land and sea.

now, goddesses, throw helicon wide open: begin your song
of the company that followed aeneas from tuscan shores,
arming the ships and riding over the seas.
massicus cut the waters at their head, in the bronze-armoured tiger,
a band of a thousand warriors under him, leaving the walls
of clusium, and the city of cosae, whose weapons are arrows,
held in light quivers over their shoulders, and deadly bows.
grim abas was with him: whose ranks were all splendidly
armoured, his ship aglow with a gilded figure of apollo.
populonia, the mother-city, had given him six hundred
of her offspring, all expert in war, and the island of ilva, rich
with the chalybes’ inexhaustible mines, three hundred.
asilas was third, that interpreter of gods and men,
to whom the entrails of beasts were an open book, the stars
in the sky, the tongues of birds, the prophetic bolts of lightning.
he hurried his thousand men to war, dense ranks bristling with spears.
pisa ordered them to obey, city of alphean foundation,
set on etruscan soil. then the most handsome astur
followed, astur relying on horse and iridescent armour.
three hundred more (minded to follow as one) were added
by those with their home in caere, the fields
by the minio, ancient pyrgi, unhealthy graviscae.
i would not forget you, cunerus, in war the bravest
ligurian leader, or you with your small company, cupavo,
on whose crest the swan plumes rose, a sign of your father’s
transformation (cupid, your and your mother’s crime).
for they say that cycnus wept for his beloved phaethon,
singing amongst the poplar leaves, those shades of phaethon’s
sisters, consoling his sorrowful passion with the muse,
and drew white age over himself, in soft plumage,
relinquishing earth, and seeking the stars with song.
his son, cupavo, drove on the mighty centaur, following
the fleet, with troops of his own age: the figurehead towered
over the water, threatening from above to hurl a huge rock
into the waves, the long keel ploughing through the deep ocean.
ocnus, also, called up troops from his native shores,
he, the son of manto the prophetess and the tuscan river,
who gave you your walls, mantua, and his mother’s name,
mantua rich in ancestors, but not all of one race:
there were three races there, under each race four tribes,
herself the head of the tribes, her strength from tuscan blood.
from there too mezentius drove five hundred to arm against him,
lead in pine warships through the sea by a figure, the river mincius,
the child of lake benacus, crowned with grey-green reeds.
aulestes ploughed on weightily, lashing the waves as he surged
to the stroke of a hundred oars: the waters foamed as the surface churned.
he sailed the huge triton, whose conch shell alarmed the blue waves,
it’s carved prow displayed a man’s form down to the waist,
as it sailed on, its belly ending in a sea-creature’s, while
under the half-man’s chest the waves murmured with foam.
such was the count of princes chosen to sail in the thirty ships
to the aid of troy, and plough the salt plains with their bronze rams.

bkx:215-259 the nymphs of cybele

now daylight had vanished from the sky and kindly phoebe
was treading mid-heaven with her nocturnal team:
aeneas (since care allowed his limbs no rest) sat there
controlling the helm himself, and tending the sails.
and see, in mid-course, a troop of his own friends
appeared: the nymphs, whom gracious cybele
had commanded to be goddesses of the sea,
to be nymphs not ships, swam beside him and cut the flood,
as many as the bronze prows that once lay by the shore.
they knew the king from far off, and circled him dancing:
and cymodocea, following, most skilful of them in speech,
caught at the stern with her right hand, lifted her length herself,
and paddled along with her left arm under the silent water.
then she spoke to the bemused man, so: ‘are you awake, aeneas,
child of the gods? be awake: loose the sheets: make full sail.
we are your fleet, now nymphs of the sea, once pines of ida,
from her sacred peak. against our will we broke our bonds
when the treacherous rutulian was pressing us hard,
with fire and sword, and we have sought you over the waves.
cybele, the mother, refashioned us in this form, from pity,
granting that we became goddesses, spending life under the waves.
now, your son ascanius is penned behind walls and ditches,
among weapons, and latins bristling for a fight.
the arcadian horse, mixed with brave etruscans already hold
the positions commanded: while turnus’s certain purpose
is to send his central squadrons against them, lest they reach the camp.
up then, in the rising dawn, call your friends with an order
to arm, and take your invincible shield that the lord of fire
gave you himself, that he circled with a golden rim.
if you don’t think my words idle, tomorrow’s light
will gaze on a mighty heap of rutulian dead.’
she spoke, and, knowing how, with her right hand,
thrust the high stern on, as she left: it sped through the waves
faster than a javelin, or an arrow equalling the wind.
then the others quickened speed. amazed, the trojan son
of anchises marvelled, yet his spirits lifted at the omen.
then looking up to the arching heavens he briefly prayed:
‘kind cybele, mother of the gods, to whom dindymus,
tower-crowned cities, and harnessed lions are dear,
be my leader now in battle, duly further this omen,
and be with your trojans, goddess, with your favouring step.’
he prayed like this, and meanwhile the wheeling day
rushed in with a flood of light, chasing away the night:
first he ordered his comrades to obey his signals,
prepare their spirits for fighting, and ready themselves for battle.

bkx:260-307 aeneas reaches land

now, he stood on the high stern, with the trojans and his fort
in view, and at once lifted high the blazing shield, in his left hand.
the trojans on the walls raised a shout to the sky, new hope
freshened their fury, they hurled their spears, just as strymonian
cranes under dark clouds, flying through the air, give noisy
cries, and fleeing the south wind, trail their clamour.
this seemed strange to the rutulian king and the italian
leaders, until looking behind them they saw the fleet
turned towards shore, and the whole sea alive with ships.
aeneas’s crest blazed, and a dark flame streamed from the top,
and the shield’s gold boss spouted floods of fire:
just as when comets glow, blood-red and ominous in the clear night,
or when fiery sirius, bringer of drought and plague
to frail mortals, rises and saddens the sky with sinister light.
still, brave turnus did not lose hope of seizing the shore first,
and driving the approaching enemy away from land.
and he raised his men’s spirits as well, and chided them:
‘what you asked for in prayer is here, to break through
with the sword. mars himself empowers your hands, men!
now let each remember his wife and home, now recall
the great actions, the glories of our fathers. and let’s
meet them in the waves, while they’re unsure and
their first steps falter as they land. fortune favours the brave.’
so he spoke, and asked himself whom to lead in attack
and whom he could trust the siege of the walls.
meanwhile aeneas landed his allies from the tall ships
using gangways. many waited for the spent wave to ebb
and trusted themselves to the shallow water: others rowed.
tarchon, noting a strand where no waves heaved
and no breaking waters roared, but the sea swept in
smoothly with the rising tide, suddenly turned
his prow towards it, exhorting his men:
‘now, o chosen band, bend to your sturdy oars:
lift, drive your boats, split this enemy shore
with your beaks, let the keel itself plough a furrow.
i don’t shrink from wrecking the ship in such a harbour
once i’ve seized the land.’ when tarchon had finished
speaking so, his comrades rose to the oars and drove
their foam-wet ships onto the latin fields,
till the rams gained dry ground and all the hulls
came to rest unharmed. but not yours, tarchon,
since, striking the shallows, she hung on an uneven ridge
poised for a while, unbalanced, and, tiring the waves,
broke and pitched her crew into the water,
broken oars and floating benches obstructed them
and at the same time the ebbing waves sucked at their feet.

bkx:308-425 the pitched battle

but the long delay didn’t keep turnus back: swiftly he moved
his whole front against the trojans, and stood against them on the shore.
the trumpets sounded. aeneas, first, attacked the ranks
of farmers, as a sign of battle, and toppled the latins,
killing theron, noblest of men, who unprompted
sought out aeneas. the sword drank from his side, pierced
through the bronze joints, and the tunic scaled with gold.
then he struck lichas, who had been cut from the womb
of his dead mother and consecrated to you, phoebus: why
was he allowed to evade the blade at birth? soon after,
he toppled in death tough cisseus, and huge gyas, as they
laid men low with their clubs: hercules’s weapons
were no help, nor their stout hands nor melampus their father,
hercules’s friend, while earth granted him heavy labours.
see, aeneas hurled his javelin as pharus uttered
words in vain, and planted it in his noisy gullet.
you too, unhappy cydon, as you followed clytius, your new
delight, his cheeks golden with youthful down, you too
would have fallen beneath the trojan hand, and lain there,
wretched, free of that love of youth that was ever yours,
had the massed ranks of your brothers, not opposed him,
the children of phorcus, seven in number, seven the spears
they threw: some glanced idly from helmet and shield,
some gentle venus deflected, so they only grazed
his body. aeneas spoke to faithful achates:
‘supply me with spears, those that lodged in the bodies
of greeks on ilium’s plain: my right hand won’t hurl
any at these rutulians in vain.’ then he grasped a great javelin
and threw it: flying on, it crashed through the bronze
of maeon’s shield, smashing breastplate and breast in one go.
his brother alcanor was there, supporting his brother
with his right arm as he fell: piercing the arm, the spear
flew straight on, keeping its blood-wet course,
and the lifeless arm hung by the shoulder tendons.
then numitor, ripping the javelin from his brother’s body,
aimed at aeneas: but he could not strike at him
in return, and grazed great achates’s thigh.
now clausus of cures approached, relying on his youthful
strength, and hit dryopes under the chin from a distance away,
with his rigid spear, driven with force, and, piercing his throat
as he spoke, took his voice and life together: he hit the ground
with his forehead, and spewed thick blood from his mouth.
clausus toppled, in various ways, three thracians too,
of boreas’s exalted race, and three whom idas their father
and their native ismarus sent out. halaesus ran to join him,
and the auruncan band, and messapus, neptune’s scion,
with his glorious horses. now one side, now the other strained
to push back the enemy: the struggle was at the very
threshold of italy. as warring winds, equal in force
and purpose, rise to do battle in the vast heavens
and between them neither yield either clouds or sea:
the battle is long in doubt, all things stand locked in conflict:
so the ranks of troy clashed with the latin ranks,
foot against foot, man pressed hard against man.
but in another place, where a torrent had rolled and scattered
boulders, with bushes torn from the banks, far and wide,
pallas, seeing his arcadians unused to charging in ranks
on foot turning to run from the pursuing latins, because
the nature of the ground, churned by water, had persuaded them to leave
their horses for once, now with prayers, and now with bitter words,
the sole recourse in time of need, fired their courage:
‘friends, where are you running to? don’t trust to flight,
by your brave deeds, by king evander’s name,
and the wars you’ve won, and my hopes, now seeking
to emulate my father’s glory. we must hack a way through
the enemy with our swords. your noble country calls you
and your leader pallas, to where the ranks of men are densest.
no gods attack us. we are mortals driven before a mortal foe:
we have as many lives, as many hands as they do.
look, the ocean closes us in with a vast barrier of water,
there’s no land left to flee to: shall we seek the seas or troy?’
he spoke, and rushed into the midst of the close-packed enemy.
lagus met him first, drawn there by a hostile fate.
as he tore at a huge weight of stone, pallas pierced him
where the spine parts the ribs in two, with the spear he hurled,
and plucked out the spear again as it lodged in the bone.
nor did hisbo surprise him from above, hopeful though he was,
since, as he rushed in, raging recklessly at his friend’s cruel death,
pallas intercepted him first, and buried his sword in his swollen chest.
next pallas attacked sthenius, and anchemolus, of rhoetus’s
ancient line, who had dared to violate his step-mother’s bed.
you, twin brothers, also fell in the rutulian fields, laridus
and thymber, the sons of daucus, so alike you were
indistinguishable to kin, and a dear confusion to your parents:
but now pallas has given you a cruel separateness.
for evander’s sword swept off your head, thymber:
while your right hand, laridus, sought its owner,
and the dying fingers twitched and clutched again at the sword.
fired by his rebuke and seeing his glorious deeds, a mixture
of remorse and pain roused the arcadians against their enemy.
then pallas pierced rhoetus as he shot past in his chariot.
ilus gained that much time and that much respite,
since he had launched his solid spear at ilus from far off,
which rhoetus received, as he fled from you, noble teuthras
and your brother tyres, and rolling from the chariot
he struck the rutulian fields with his heels as he died.
as in summer, when a hoped-for wind has risen,
the shepherd sets scattered fires in the woods,
the spaces between catch light, and vulcan’s bristling
ranks extend over the broad fields, while the shepherd sits
and gazes down in triumph over the joyful flames:
so all your comrades’ courage united as one
to aid you pallas. but halaesus, fierce in war,
advanced against them and gathered himself behind his shield.
he killed ladon, pheres and demodocus, struck off
strymonius’s right hand, raised towards his throat,
with his shining sword, and smashed thoas in the face
with a stone, scattering bone mixed with blood and brain.
halaesus’s father, prescient of fate, had hidden him in the woods:
but when, in white-haired old age, the father closed his eyes in death,
the fates laid their hands on halaesus and doomed him
to evander’s spear. pallas attacked him first praying:
‘grant luck to the spear i aim to throw, father tiber,
and a path through sturdy halaesus’s chest. your oak
shall have the these weapons and the soldier’s spoils.’
the god heard his prayer: while halaesus covered imaon
he sadly exposed his unshielded chest to the arcadian spear.

bkx:426-509 the death of pallas

but lausus, a powerful force in the war, would not allow
his troops to be dismayed by the hero’s great slaughter:
first he killed abas opposite, a knotty obstacle in the battle.
the youth of arcadia fell, the etruscans fell, and you,
o trojans, men not even destroyed by the greeks.
the armies met, equal in leadership and strength:
the rear and front closed ranks, and the crush prevented
weapons or hands from moving. here, pallas pressed and urged,
there lausus opposed him, not many years between them,
both of outstanding presence, but fortune had denied them
a return to their country. yet the king of great olympos
did not allow them to meet face to face: their fate
was waiting for them soon, at the hand of a greater opponent.
meanwhile turnus’s gentle sister juturna adjured him to help
lausus, and he parted the ranks between in his swift chariot.
when he saw his comrades he cried: ‘it’s time to hold back
from the fight: it’s for me alone to attack pallas, pallas
is mine alone: i wish his father were here to see it.’
and his comrades drew back from the field as ordered.
when the rutulians retired, then the youth, amazed at that proud
command, marvelled at turnus, casting his eyes over
the mighty body, surveying all of him from the distance
with a fierce look, and answered the ruler’s words with these:
‘i’ll soon be praised for taking rich spoils, or for a glorious death:
my father is equal to either fate for me: away with your threats.’
so saying he marched down the centre of the field:
the blood gathered, chill, in arcadian hearts.
turnus leapt from his chariot, preparing to close on foot,
and the sight of the advancing turnus, was no different
than that of a lion, seeing from a high point a bull far off
on the plain contemplating battle, and rushing down.
but pallas came forward first, when he thought turnus might
be within spear-throw, so that chance might help him, in venturing
his unequal strength, and so he spoke to the mighty heavens:
‘i pray you, hercules, by my father’s hospitality and the feast
to which you came as a stranger, assist my great enterprise.
let me strip the blood-drenched armour from his dying limbs,
and let turnus’s failing sight meet its conqueror.’
hercules heard the youth, and stifled a heavy sigh
deep in his heart, and wept tears in vain.
then jupiter the father spoke to hercules, his son,
with kindly words: ‘every man has his day, the course
of life is brief and cannot be recalled: but virtue’s task
is this, to increase fame by deeds. so many sons of gods
fell beneath the high walls of troy, yes, and my own son
sarpedon among them: fate calls even for turnus,
and he too has reached the end of the years granted to him.’
so he spoke, and turned his eyes from the rutulian fields.
then pallas threw his spear with all his might,
and snatched his gleaming sword from its hollow sheath.
the shaft flew and struck turnus, where the top of the armour
laps the shoulder, and forcing a way through the rim
of his shield at last, even grazed his mighty frame.
at this, turnus hurled his oak spear tipped
with sharp steel, long levelled at pallas, saying:
‘see if this weapon of mine isn’t of greater sharpness.’
the spear-head, with a quivering blow, tore through
the centre of his shield, passed through all the layers
of iron, of bronze, all the overlapping bull’s-hide,
piercing the breastplate, and the mighty chest.
vainly he pulled the hot spear from the wound:
blood and life followed, by one and the same path.
he fell in his own blood (his weapons clanged over him)
and he struck the hostile earth in death with gory lips.
then turnus, standing over him, cried out:
‘arcadians, take note, and carry these words of mine
to evander: i return pallas to him as he deserves.
i freely give whatever honours lie in a tomb, whatever
solace there is in burial. his hospitality to aeneas
will cost him greatly.’ so saying he planted his left foot on the corpse,
and tore away the huge weight of pallas’s belt, engraved
with the danaids’ crime: that band of young men foully murdered
on the same wedding night: the blood-drenched marriage chambers:
that clonus, son of eurytus had richly chased in gold.
now turnus exulted at the spoil, and gloried in winning.
oh, human mind, ignorant of fate or fortune to come,
or of how to keep to the limits, exalted by favourable events!
the time will come for turnus when he’d prefer to have bought
an untouched pallas at great price, and will hate those spoils
and the day. so his friends crowded round pallas with many
groans and tears, and carried him back, lying on his shield.
o the great grief and glory in returning to your father:
that day first gave you to warfare, the same day took you from it,
while nevertheless you left behind vast heaps of rutulian dead!

bkx:510-605 aeneas rages in battle

now not merely a rumour of this great evil, but a more trustworthy
messenger flew to aeneas, saying that his men were a hair’s breadth
from death, that it was time to help the routed trojans. seeking you,
turnus, you, proud of your fresh slaughter, he mowed down
his nearest enemies, with the sword, and fiercely drove a wide path
through the ranks with its blade. pallas, evander, all was before
his eyes, the feast to which he had first come as a stranger,
the right hands pledged in friendship. then he captured
four youths alive, sons of sulmo, and as many reared
by ufens, to sacrifice to the shades of the dead, and sprinkle
the flames of the pyre with the prisoners’ blood.
next he aimed a hostile spear at magus from a distance:
magus moved in cleverly, and the spear flew over him, quivering,
and he clasped the hero’s knees as a suppliant, and spoke as follows:
‘i beg you, by your father’s shade, by your hope in your boy
iulus, preserve my life, for my son and my father.
i have a noble house: talents of chased silver lie buried there:
i have masses of wrought and unwrought gold. troy’s victory
does not rest with me: one life will not make that much difference.’
aeneas replied to him in this way: ‘keep those many talents
of silver and gold you mention for your sons. turnus, before we spoke,
did away with the courtesies of war, the moment he killed pallas.
so my father anchises’s spirit thinks, so does iulus.’
saying this he held the helmet with his left hand and, bending
the suppliant’s neck backwards, drove in his sword to the hilt.
haemon’s son, a priest of apollo and diana, was not far away,
the band with its sacred ribbons circling his temples, and all
his robes and emblems shining white. aeneas met him and drove him
over the plain, then, standing over the fallen man, killed him and cloaked
him in mighty darkness: serestus collected and carried off
his weapons on his shoulders, a trophy for you, king gradivus.
caeculus, born of the race of vulcan, and umbro
who came from the marsian hills restored order,
the trojan raged against them: his sword sliced off anxur’s
left arm, it fell to the ground with the whole disc of his shield
(anxur had shouted some boast, trusting the power
of words, lifting his spirit high perhaps, promising
himself white-haired old age and long years):
then tarquitus nearby, proud in his gleaming armour,
whom the nymph dryope had born to faunus of the woods,
exposed himself to fiery aeneas. he, drawing back his spear,
pinned the breastplate and the huge weight of shield together:
then as the youth begged in vain, and tried to utter a flow of words,
he struck his head to the ground and, rolling the warm trunk over,
spoke these words above him, from a hostile heart:
‘lie there now, one to be feared. no noble mother will bury you
in the earth, nor weight your limbs with an ancestral tomb:
you’ll be left for the carrion birds, or, sunk in the abyss,
the flood will bear you, and hungry fish suck your wounds.’
then he caught up with antaeus, and lucas, in turnus’s
front line, brave numa and auburn camers, son of noble volcens,
the wealthiest in ausonian land, who ruled silent amyclae.
once his sword was hot, victorious aeneas raged
over the whole plain, like aegeaon, who had a hundred
arms and a hundred hands they say, and breathed fire
from fifty chests and mouths, when he clashed
with as many like shields of his and drew as many swords
against jove’s lightning-bolts. see now he was headed
towards the four horse team of niphaeus’s chariot
and the opposing front. and when the horses saw him taking
great strides in his deadly rage, they shied and galloped in fear,
throwing their master, and dragging the chariot to the shore.
meanwhile lucagus and his brother liger entered the fray
in their chariot with two white horses: liger handling
the horses’ reins, fierce lucagus waving his naked sword.
aeneas could not tolerate such furious hot-headedness:
he rushed at them, and loomed up gigantic with levelled spear.
liger said to him: ‘these are not diomedes’s horses
that you see, nor achille’s chariot, nor phrygia’s plain:
now you’ll be dealt an end to your war and life.’
such were the words that flew far, from foolish
liger’s lips. but the trojan hero did not ready
words in reply, he hurled his spear then against his enemies.
while lucagus urged on his horses, leaning forward
towards the spear’s blow, as, with left foot advanced,
he prepared himself for battle, the spear entered the lower
rim of his bright shield, then pierced the left thigh:
thrown from the chariot he rolled on the ground in death:
while noble aeneas spoke bitter words to him:
‘lucagus, it was not the flight of your horses in fear that betrayed
your chariot, or the enemy’s idle shadow that turned them:
it was you, leaping from the wheels, who relinquished the reins.’
so saying he grasped at the chariot: the wretched brother,
liger, who had fallen as well, held, out his helpless hands:
‘trojan hero, by your own life, by your parents who bore
such a son, take pity i beg you, without taking this life away.’
as he begged more urgently, aeaneas said: ‘those were not
the words you spoke before. die and don’t let brother desert brother.’
then he sliced open his chest where the life is hidden.
such were the deaths the trojan leader caused across
that plain, raging like a torrent of water or a dark
tempest. at last his child, ascanius, and the men
who were besieged in vain, breaking free, left the camp.

bkx:606-688 juno withdraws turnus from the fight

meanwhile jupiter, unasked, spoke to juno:
‘o my sister, and at the same time my dearest wife,
as you thought (your judgement is not wrong)
it is venus who sustains the trojans’ power,
not their own right hands, so ready for war,
nor their fierce spirits, tolerant of danger.’
juno spoke submissively to him: ‘o loveliest of husbands
why do you trouble me, who am ill, and fearful of your
harsh commands? if my love had the power it once had,
that is my right, you, all-powerful, would surely not
deny me this, to withdraw turnus from the conflict
and save him, unharmed, for his father, daunus.
let him die then, let him pay the trojans in innocent blood.
yet he derives his name from our line: pilumnus
was his ancestor four generations back, and often weighted
your threshold with copious gifts from a lavish hand.’
the king of heavenly olympus briefly replied to her like this:
‘if your prayer is for reprieve from imminent death
for your doomed prince, and you understand i so ordain it,
take turnus away, in flight, snatch him from oncoming fate:
there’s room for that much indulgence. but if thought
of any greater favour hides behind your prayers, and you think
this whole war may be deflected or altered, you nurture a vain hope.’
and juno, replied, weeping: ‘why should your mind not grant
what your tongue withholds, and life be left to turnus?
now, guiltless, a heavy doom awaits him or i stray empty
of truth. oh, that i might be mocked by false fears,
and that you, who are able to, might harbour kinder speech!
when she had spoken these words, she darted down at once
from high heaven through the air, driving a storm before her,
and wreathed in cloud, and sought the ranks of ilium
and the laurentine camp. then from the cavernous mist
the goddess decked out a weak and tenuous phantom,
in the likeness of aeneas, with trojan weapons (a strange
marvel to behold), simulated his shield, and the plumes
on his godlike head, gave it insubstantial speech,
gave it sound without mind, and mimicked the way
he walked: like shapes that flit, they say, after death,
or dreams that in sleep deceive the senses.
and the phantom flaunted itself exultantly
in front of the leading ranks, provoking turnus
with spear casts, and exasperating him with words.
turnus ran at it, and hurled a hissing spear
from the distance: it turned its heels in flight.
then, as turnus thought that aeneas had retreated
and conceded, and in his confusion clung to this idle hope
in his mind, he cried: ‘where are you off to, aeneas?
don’t desert your marriage pact: this hand of mine
will grant you the earth you looked for over the seas.’
he pursued him, calling loudly, brandishing his naked sword,
not seeing that the wind was carrying away his glory.
it chanced that the ship, in which king osinius sailed
from clusium’s shores, was moored to a high stone pier,
with ladders released and gangway ready. the swift phantom
of fleeing aeneas sank into it to hide, and turnus followed
no less swiftly, conquering all obstacles and leapt
up the high gangway. he had barely reached the prow
when saturn’s daughter snapped the cable,
and, snatching the ship, swept it over the waters.
then the vague phantom no longer tried to hide
but, flying into the air, merged with a dark cloud.
meanwhile aeneas himself was challenging his missing enemy
to battle: and sending many opposing warriors to their deaths,
while the storm carried turnus over the wide ocean.
unaware of the truth, and ungrateful for his rescue,
he looked back and raised clasped hands and voice to heaven:
‘all-powerful father, did you think me so worthy of punishment,
did you intend me to pay such a price? where am i being taken?
from whom am i escaping? why am i fleeing: how will i return?
will i see the walls and camp of laurentium again?
what of that company of men that followed me, and my standard?
have i left them all (the shame of it) to a cruel death,
seeing them scattered now, hearing the groans as they fall?
what shall i do? where is the earth that could gape
wide enough for me? rather have pity on me, o winds:
drive the ship on the rocks, the reefs (i, turnus, beg you, freely)
or send it into the vicious quicksands, where no rutulian,
nor any knowing rumour of my shame can follow me?
so saying he debated this way and that in his mind,
whether he should throw himself on his sword, mad
with such disgrace, and drive the cruel steel through his ribs,
or plunge into the waves, and, by swimming, gain
the curving bay, and hurl himself again at the trojan weapons.
three times he attempted each: three times great juno
held him back, preventing him from heartfelt pity. he glided on,
with the help of wave and tide, cutting the depths,
and was carried to his father daunus’s ancient city.

bkx:689-754 mezentius rages in battle

but meanwhile fiery mezentius, warned by jupiter,
took up the fight, and attacked the jubilant trojans.
the etruscan ranks closed up, and concentrated
all their hatred, and showers of missiles, on him alone.
he (like a vast cliff that juts out into the vast deep,
confronting the raging winds, and exposed to the waves,
suffering the force and threat of sky and sea,
itself left unshaken) felled hebrus, son of dolichaon,
to the earth, with him were latagus and swift palmus,
but he anticipated latagus, with a huge fragment of rock
from the hillside in his mouth and face, while he hamstrung
palmus and left him writhing helplessly: he gave lausus the armour
to protect his shoulders, and the plumes to wear on his crest.
he killed evanthes too, the phrygian, and mimas, paris’s
friend and peer, whom theano bore to his father amycus
on the same night hecuba, cisseus’s royal daughter, pregnant
with a firebrand, gave birth to paris: paris lies in the city
of his fathers, the laurentine shore holds the unknown mimas.
and as a boar, that piny vesulus has sheltered
for many years and laurentine marshes have nourished
with forests of reeds, is driven from the high hills,
by snapping hounds, and halts when it reaches the nets,
snorts fiercely, hackles bristling, no one brave enough
to rage at it, or approach it, but all attacking it with spears,
and shouting from a safe distance: halts, unafraid,
turning in every direction, grinding its jaws,
and shaking the spears from its hide: so none of those
who were rightly angered with mezentius had the courage
to meet him with naked sword, but provoked him
from afar with their missiles, and a mighty clamour.
acron, a greek had arrived there from the ancient lands
of corythus, an exile, his marriage ceremony left incomplete.
when mezentius saw him in the distance, embroiled
among the ranks, with crimson plumes, and in purple robes
given by his promised bride, he rushed eagerly into the thick
of the foe, as a ravenous lion often ranges the high coverts
(since a raging hunger drives it) and exults, with vast gaping jaws,
if it chances to see a fleeing roe-deer, or a stag with immature horns,
then clings crouching over the entrails, with bristling mane,
its cruel mouth stained hideously with blood.
wretched acron fell, striking the dark earth with his heels
in dying, drenching his shattered weapons with blood.
and he did not even deign to kill orodes as he fled,
or inflict a hidden wound with a thrust of his spear:
he ran to meet him on the way, and opposed him man to man,
getting the better of him by force of arms not stealth.
then setting his foot on the fallen man, and straining at his spear,
he called out: ‘soldiers, noble orodes lies here, he was no small part
of this battle.’ his comrades shouted, taking up the joyful cry:
yet orodes, dying, said: ‘whoever you are, winner here,
i’ll not go unavenged, nor will you rejoice for long:
a like fate watches for you: you’ll soon lie in these same fields.’
mezentius replied, grinning with rage: ‘die now,
as for me, the father of gods and king of men will see to that.’
so saying he withdrew his spear from the warrior’s body.
enduring rest, and iron sleep, pressed on orodes’s eyes,
and their light was shrouded in eternal night.
caedicus killed alcathous: sacrator killed hydapses:
rapo killed parthenius, and orses of outstanding strength.
messapus killed clonius, and ericetes, son of lycaon,
one lying on the ground fallen from his bridle-less horse,
the other still on his feet. lycian agis had advanced his feet
but valerus overthrew him, with no lack of his ancestors’ skill:
salius killed thronius, and nealces, famed for the javelin,
and the deceptive long-distance arrow, in turn killed salcius.

bkx:755-832 the death of mezentius’s son, lausus

now grievous war dealt grief and death mutually:
they killed alike, and alike they died, winners and losers,
and neither one nor the other knew how to flee.
the gods in jupiter’s halls pitied the useless anger of them both,
and that such pain existed for mortal beings:
here venus gazed down, here, opposite, saturnian juno.
pale tisiphone raged among the warring thousands.
and now mezentius shaking his mighty spear,
advanced like a whirlwind over the field. great as orion,
when he strides through ocean’s deepest chasms, forging a way,
his shoulders towering above the waves, or carrying
an ancient manna ash down from the mountain heights,
walking the earth, with his head hidden in the clouds,
so mezentius advanced in his giant’s armour.
aeneas, opposite, catching sight of him in the far ranks
prepared to go and meet him. mezentius stood there unafraid,
waiting for his great-hearted enemy, firm in his great bulk:
and measuring with his eye what distance would suit his spear,
saying: ‘now let this right hand that is my god, and the weapon
i level to throw, aid me! i vow that you yourself, lausus, as token
of my victory over aeneas, shall be dressed in the spoils stripped
from that robber’s corpse.’ he spoke, and threw the hissing spear
from far out. but, flying on, it glanced from the shield,
and pierced the handsome antores, nearby, between flank
and thigh, antores, friend of hercules, sent from argos
who had joined evander, and settled in an italian city.
unhappy man, he fell to a wound meant for another,
and dying, gazing at the sky, remembered sweet argos.
then virtuous aeneas hurled a spear: it passed through
mezentius’s curved shield of triple-bronze, through linen,
and the interwoven layers of three bull’s hides, and lodged
deep in the groin, but failed to drive home with force.
aeneas, joyful at the sight of the tuscan blood,
snatched the sword from his side, and pressed
his shaken enemy hotly. lausus, seeing it, groaned heavily
for love of his father, and tears rolled down his cheeks –
and here i’ll not be silent, for my part, about your harsh death,
through fate, nor, if future ages place belief in such deeds, your actions,
so glorious, nor you yourself, youth, worthy of remembrance –
his father was retreating, yielding ground, helpless,
hampered, dragging the enemy lance along with his shield.
the youth ran forward, and plunged into the fray,
and, just as aeneas’s right hand lifted to strike a blow,
he snatched at the sword-point, and checked him in delay:
his friends followed with great clamour, and, with a shower
of spears, forced the enemy to keep his distance till the father
could withdraw, protected by his son’s shield.
aeneas raged, but kept himself under cover.
as every ploughman and farmer runs from the fields
when storm-clouds pour down streams of hail,
and the passer by shelters in a safe corner, under a river
bank or an arch of high rock, while the rain falls to earth,
so as to pursue the day’s work when the sun returns:
so, overwhelmed by missiles from every side,
aeneas endured the clouds of war, while they all thundered,
and rebuked lausus, and threatened lausus, saying:
‘why are you rushing to death, with courage beyond your strength?
your loyalty’s betraying you to foolishness.’ nevertheless
the youth raged madly, and now fierce anger rose higher
in the trojan leader’s heart, and the fates gathered together
the last threads of lausus’s life. for aeneas drove his sword
firmly through the youth’s body, and buried it to the hilt:
the point passed through his shield, too light for his threats,
and the tunic of soft gold thread his mother had woven,
blood filled its folds: then life left the body and fled,
sorrowing, through the air to the spirits below.
and when anchises’s son saw the look on his dying face,
that face pale with the wonderment of its ending,
he groaned deeply with pity and stretched out his hand,
as that reflection of his own love for his father touched
his heart. ‘unhappy child, what can loyal aeneas grant
to such a nature, worthy of these glorious deeds of yours?
keep the weapons you delighted in: and if it is something you are
anxious about, i return you to the shades and ashes of your ancestors.
this too should solace you, unhappy one, for your sad death:
you died at the hands of great aeneas.’ also he rebuked
lausus’s comrades, and lifted their leader from the earth,
where he was soiling his well-ordered hair with blood.

bkx:833-908 the death of mezentius

meanwhile the father, mezentius, staunched his wounds
by the waters of tiber’s river, and rested his body
by leaning against a tree trunk. his bronze helmet hung
on a nearby branch, and his heavy armour lay peacefully on the grass.
the pick of his warriors stood around: he himself, weak and panting
eased his neck, his flowing beard streaming over his chest.
many a time he asked for lausus, and many times sent men
to carry him a sorrowing father’s orders and recall him.
but his weeping comrades were carrying the dead lausus,
on his armour, a great man conquered by a mighty wound.
the mind prescient of evil, knew their sighs from far off.
mezentius darkened his white hair with dust, and lifted
both hands to heaven, clinging to the body:
‘my son, did such delight in living possess me,
that i let you face the enemy force in my place,
you whom i fathered? is this father of yours alive
through your death, saved by your wounds? ah, now at last
my exile is wretchedly driven home: and my wound, deeply!
my son, i have also tarnished your name by my crime,
driven in hatred from my fathers’ throne and sceptre.
i have long owed reparation to my country and my people’s hatred:
i should have yielded my guilty soul to death in any form!
now i live: i do not leave humankind yet, or the light,
but i will leave.’ so saying he raised himself weakly on his thigh,
and, despite all, ordered his horse to be brought, though his strength
ebbed from the deep wound. his mount was his pride,
and it was his solace, on it he had ridden victorious from every battle.
he spoke to the sorrowful creature, in these words:
‘rhaebus, we have lived a long time, if anything lasts long
for mortal beings. today you will either carry the head of aeneas,
and his blood-stained spoils, in victory, and avenge lausus’s pain
with me, or die with me, if no power opens that road to us:
i don’t think that you, the bravest of creatures, will deign
to suffer a stranger’s orders or a trojan master.’
he spoke, then, mounting, disposed his limbs as usual,
and weighted each hand with a sharp javelin,
his head gleaming with bronze, bristling with its horsehair crest.
so he launched himself quickly into the fray. in that one heart
a vast flood of shame and madness merged with grief.
and now he called to aeneas in a great voice.
aeneas knew him and offered up a joyous prayer:
‘so let the father of the gods himself decree it, so
noble apollo! you then begin the conflict….’
he spoke those words and moved against him with level spear.
but mezentius replied: ‘how can you frighten me, most savage
of men, me, bereft of my son? that was the only way you could
destroy me: i do not shrink from death, or halt for any god.
cease, since i come here to die, and bring you, first,
these gifts.’ he spoke, and hurled a spear at his enemy:
then landed another and yet another, wheeling
in a wide circle, but the gilded shield withstood them.
he rode three times round his careful enemy, widdershins,
throwing darts from his hand: three times the trojan hero
dragged round the huge thicket of spears fixed in his bronze shield.
then tired of all that drawn-out delay, and burdened
by the unequal conflict, he thought hard, and finally broke free,
hurling his spear straight between the war horse’s curved temples.
the animal reared, and lashed the air with its hooves,
and throwing its rider, followed him down, from above,
entangling him, collapsing headlong onto him, its shoulder thrown.
trojans and latins ignited the heavens with their shouts.
aeneas ran to him, plucking his sword from its sheath
and standing over him, cried: ‘where is fierce mezentius, now,
and the savage force of that spirit?’ the tuscan replied, as, lifting
his eyes to the sky, and gulping the air, he regained his thoughts:
‘bitter enemy, why taunt, or threaten me in death?
there is no sin in killing: i did not come to fight believing so,
nor did my lausus agree any treaty between you and me.
i only ask, by whatever indulgence a fallen enemy might claim,
that my body be buried in the earth. i know that my people’s
fierce hatred surrounds me: protect me, i beg you,
from their anger, and let me share a tomb with my son.’
so he spoke, and in full awareness received the sword in his throat,
and poured out his life, over his armour, in a wave of blood."

i can give up now, but i can promise you forever though


if there's a question of my heart, you've got it
it don't belong to anyone but you
if there's a question of my love, you've got it
baby, don't worry, i've got plans for you
baby, i've been making plans, oh love
baby, i've been making plans for you
baby, i've been making plans
baby, i've been making plans for you


(realest shit i ever wrote, realest shit i ever wrote
realest shit i ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
i’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
the day i find a woman i prolly be scared to share it
the idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
and true my wall could use some plaques, but still i gotta floss
brush you off, see i'm kinda lost
now i'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
and dark, good nigga, troubled heart
went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
this is hard, tryna find some time to move on
cause when we lost our baby, i got shady, shit got too dark
soft, and i thank you baby, you strong
my ex before you married too, you solo, i say so long
nah, good terms how that ended
but it surely put a dent on how i worry about this business
off white picket fences, on flights with the children
on site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but


but i plan to do it better though
but you still sayin' let it go
we ain't gettin' any younger
women love me now but in your eyes we forever though


if there's a question of my heart, you've got it
it don't belong to anyone but you
if there's a question of my love, you've got it
baby, don't worry, i've got plans for you
baby, i've been making plans, oh baby
i've been making plans, oh love
baby, i've been making plans for you
baby, i've been making plans
baby, i've been making plans for you


we ain't nothin' but some planets

seinfield: i always feel like i’m a planet. and these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. and, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. and you can only do it when one planet passes real close. and you look and you go, “hey, i think i can jump across.”"

Love a Loser (feat. G-Eazy)|Cassie|r&b|"
i'd rather lose a lover than to love a loser
everything you did, i wouldn't do it to you
got my vision clear so now i'm seeing through ya
writing you a letter, i'mma send it to ya
i'd rather lose a lover than to love a loser
used to put it on ya like the kama sutra
ain't no looking back, i'm like the new medusa
got you on a sunday screaming hallelujah


i would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
rather lose a lover than to love a loser
i would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
rather lose a lover than to love a loser
think i'm under your spell
tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby i can't tell (i can't tell)
tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby i can't tell (i can't tell)
tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby i can't tell (i can't tell)


g, uh
i'd rather lose a lover than to love a loser, yeah
damn, that was my baby, thought we had a future, aye
next to all these options i would always choose her
but she's fragile, feels like every place i touch, i bruise her, aye
delicate, i fell back, i can't tell if it
really hope that hurts, she told me she been celibate
said nobody made her feel the way i did
i felt a bit, a little bit conflicted
i heard she had someone new she was messing with, fuck
i can not tell, i think i'm under her spell
i sent her flowers, and all she sent back was, ""hope all is well""
she said that love don't cost a thing but got that pussy for sale
that woman put me through hell, i fell in love, but oh well
you know? uh, oh well


smoke swirling from the cigarette (what can you do)
unless you didn't even see my silhouette (uh)
unless... you're too numb to even feel it yet (eazy)
confess, you second guessed just how real it gets (yeah)
oh yeah


i would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
rather lose a lover than to love a loser
i would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
rather lose a lover than to love a loser
think i'm under your spell
tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby i can't tell (i can't tell)
tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby i can't tell (i can't tell)
tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby i can't tell (i can't tell)"
Masterpiece (Mona Lisa)|Jazmine Sullivan|r&b|"
my eyes ain't used to these rays
i'm feeling exposed, but i can't hide no more
i can't hide
as the sun shines on all of my glory
my flaws don't look so bad at all

every part of me is a vision of a portrait
of mona, of mona lisa
every part of me is beautiful
and i finally see i'm a work of art
a masterpiece
oh oh oh


who is this i've tried so long to fight?
filling my heads with lies that i'm not good enough
then i heard something in my ear
tell me i'm perfect, now that i know the truth
time to show and prove


every part of me is a vision of a portrait
of mona, of mona lisa
every part of me is beautiful
and i finally see i'm a work of art
a masterpiece
oh oh oh


and now i see the pretty colors on my canvas
i'm a work of art, a mona lisa
i'll share my picture with the world
not afraid to let it show anymore


i can light the night, shine so bright (mona lisa, mona lisa)
(let my colors paint the sky)
i can light the night, shine so bright (mona lisa, mona lisa)
(there is beauty in my eyes)
i can light the night, shine so bright (mona lisa, mona lisa)
(and i can see it now, i believe it now, i can feel it now)
i can light the night, shine so bright (mona lisa, mona lisa)
(took a while to see i'm a work of art, i'm a masterpiece, oh)

Love All Over Me|Monica|r&b|"

i went from the ground to the top of the cloud
and now as i look down
i see where i fell into your arms


now i got love all over me
baby, you touch every part of me
oh, i got love all over me
and i don't wanna get it off
i'm completely covered up in your love

no more icy blue hearts for me
you put the color back in my life
and now where there was black and white
you're becoming iridescent


and i got love all over me
baby, you touch every part of me
oh, i, i got love all over me
and i don't wanna get it off
i'm completely covered up in your love


before your love, baby, i was muddy
so deep with pain 'til you took it from me
you showered me with a new beginning, now i'm clean
took me by surprise when you ran up on me
i came to life, baby, in that moment
you put your hands on my heart
and baby, now it beats
