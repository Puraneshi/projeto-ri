Barracuda|Heart|rock|"


so this ain't the end, i saw you again today
i had to turn my heart away
smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
and tales, it never fails!


you lying so low into the weeds
i bet you gonna ambush me
you'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
now won't you, barracuda?




back over time, we were all trying for free
you met the porpoise and me
no right, no wrong, you're selling a song, a name
whisper game


and if the real thing don't do the trick
you better make up something quick
you gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
ooh, barracuda


""sell me sell you"" the porpoise said
dive down deep to save my head
i think that you got the blues, too

all that night and all the next
swam without looking back
made for the western pools, silly, silly fools!




if the real thing don't do the trick, no
you better make up something quick
you gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick

ohh, bara-barracuda

Prayers|Good Charlotte|rock|"
born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams
where no one understands me
when i finally met an angel, i didn't know what to say
she just held my hand
and we would lay awake at night, looking at the stars
thinking of the ones we've lost, and wonder where they are
when we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame
then she put her arms around me and held me to the flame


so why do we hurt each other?
we don't need the words for one another's


prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
do they answer when you call?
these prayers, when you don't mean what you say
would you die for me today? now i just can't relate


none of this makes sense in this reality
god just leaves the room when i turn on my tv
i see a little girl who's crying 'cause she lost her family
all these strangers sending thoughts and prayers, she's buried underneath


why do we kill each other?
we can't feel the pain in one another's


prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
do they answer when you call?
these prayers, when you don't mean what you say
would you die for me today? now i just can't relate


we're so far away from one another
we keep building walls between each other's


prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
do they answer when you call?
these prayers, when you don't mean what you say
would you die for me today? now i just can't relate

let's take it easy
easy now, watch it go

on the back of a hurricane that started turning

and sometimes you close your eyes
and see the place where you used to live
when you were young

when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale


i wanna hide the truth, i wanna shelter you
but with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
no matter what we breed, we still are made of greed

so they dug your grave and the masquerade
will come calling out at the mess you made

The One You Know|Alice In Chains|rock|"
i'm a little alike
you before things had changed
inner compass aligned
all this feels rearranged


tell me, does it matter
if i'm still here, or i'm gone?
shifting to the after
an impostor, i'm not the one you know


i look the same outside
nearly me even though
i carry something i hide
underneath the one you know


tell me, does it matter
if i'm still here, or i'm gone?
shifting to the after
an impostor, soldiers on

are you surprised black water flows
from wells run dry?
i'm not the one you know




lay me out with flowered guilt
watch the explosions falling
cannot live within this tilt
carryin' over
i'm not the one you know


tell me, does it matter
if i'm still here, or i'm gone?
shifting to the after
an impostor, soldiers on

are you surprised black water flows
from wells run dry?

i don't like walking around this old and empty house

some days i can't even dress myself
it's killing me to see you this way

bodies safe to shore

there's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
well, tell her that i miss our little talks
soon it will be over and buried with our past
we used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
some days, i don't know if i am wrong or right
your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear

all that's left is a ghost of you

it called me, i should have known
as the fever sweat through the dream
told mamma that i couldn't go
so i could stay home just to watch him dancing
and you could not tell me then
like you could never, ever tell me now
that this is not who i am


plans were made while my back was turned
said baby, that is no way to live
showed me that carrot on a string but just a little too late
the bite from the taste and the smell of the sick somehow reminds me to be myself
over and over again
over and over again
over and over again
over and over again


""wanna be starting something"" taught me to sing
or maybe kiss, kiss molly's lips
on a plain he will always live
and in a round he will always be dancing
imagine where i'd be now
on these four legs i stand proud
it's the only way i know how to give

if you take a step towards me, you will take my breath away
so i'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
no one else has ever loved me, no one else has ever tried
i never understood how much i could take
then i saw the worst was over when i laid my eyes on you
it was all that i could do to know my place
out of all the vast illusions, out of all the dreams come true
i was gone until i finally saw your face


if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too


let me take a step towards you, let me feel you in my hands
let me cross this line and show you where it leads
there's a darkness down inside me that i know we'll both enjoy
and it's screaming from within to set it free
i have left this bloody nightmare in my wake but out of sight
all i want is deviation by design
out of all the past confusion, out of all the common spite
just tell me i am yours, 'cause you are mine


and if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too


it doesn't really matter what you do or say
i'm never going anywhere anyway
'cause when i'm dying for you, i've never felt so alive


if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm

i can make believe that you're here tonight
that you're here tonight


if i could find you now things would get better
we could leave this town and run forever
i know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
let your waves crash down on me
and take me away


i remember the look in your eyes
when i told you that this was goodbye
you were beggin' me not tonight
not here, not now
we're looking up at the same night sky
and keep pretendin' the sun will not rise
we'll be together for one more night
somewhere, somehow


if i could find you now things would get better
we could leave this town and run forever
i know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
let your waves crash down on me
and take me away"

Wonderful Tonight|Eric Clapton|rock|"
it's late in the evening she's wondering what clothes to wear
she puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
and then she asks me, ""do i look all right?""
and i say, ""yes, you look wonderful tonight""


we go to a party and everyone turns to see
this beautiful lady that's walking around with me
and then she asks me ""do you feel all right?""
and i say, ""yes, i feel wonderful tonight""


i feel wonderful because i see
the love light in your eyes
and the wonder of it all
is that you just don't realize how much i love you


it's time to go home now and i've got an aching head
so i give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
and then i tell her, as i turn out the light
i say, ""my darling, you were wonderful tonight
oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"""
High|Sir Sly|rock|"
i’ve been smoking on the peace pipe
i’ve been wondering just what would peace be like
i’ve been staring into headlights
swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind
i’m just trying to seize the moment
trying to love the little things, even if they’re hard to love
a monument to love unspoken
carved into stone, “unwilling to come undone”


it feels good to be running from the devil
another breath and i’m up another level
it feels good to be up above the clouds
it feels good for the first time in a long time now


i remember back in oakland
i was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
moving hotel to hotel
out on the road, no idea really what’s in store
light it up just like a flashlight
let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
turn it over and it’s capsized
it’s finally done, the battle's lost, yet i feel i’ve won


it feels good to be running from the devil
another breath and i’m up another level
it feels good to be up above the clouds
it feels good for the first time in a long time now


it feels good for the first time in a long time now
it feels good to be me


i’m high, staring at the ceiling
sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
what comes next, i see a light
i’m along for the ride as i’m taking flight


i’m high, staring at the ceiling

i was quiet as a mouse
and i swore i saw you in there
but i was looking at myself


i'm placing bets against myself
and honestly i'm a mess
like a car engulfed in flames
i am a wreck
things i should have said through call or text
i've just really been so busy and i regret


'cause if there's no rest for the wicked
i'm as evil as it gets

so i didn't show up to your funeral
but i showed up to your house
and i didn't move a muscle
i was quiet as a mouse
and i swore i saw you in there
but i was looking at myself


so will you show up to my funeral
will you be wearing white or black?

i will surely come in last

Silence Speaks (feat. Oli Sykes)|While She Sleeps|rock|"
where is your heart?
can we beat this if we all
tear the borders, break the walls
together as one?
the cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps
the guiltless restraints assured by deceit
(are we free?)
are we all alone?


if you’re gonna accuse me
of pouring too much salt in the wound
we have just proved that
they can pollute our heads with the news
they will manipulate the masses again
if you’re gonna accuse me of telling you what you already knew
it’s the same song sung with a different truth
and all of us forget it cause our head’s inside the noose
they will manipulate the masses again


yeah, yeah, yeah, we won’t forget it
you better pray for absolution
you can change but you can’t deny
the new wave in a terror nation
why do we ignore the warning signs?
board it up, the borders are shut
the blood of the innocent is under the rug
white lies in a world corrupt
are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
war will cease when we refuse to fight


where is your heart?
can we beat this if we all
tear the borders, break the walls
together as one?
the cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps
the guiltless restraints assured by deceit
(are we free?)
are we all alone?
are we all alone?


hope widows, shattered windows
restriction without effect
dead lines in silhouettes
why do we ignore the warning signs?
cold calls to derelict homes
needles at the side of the road
wires and liars like thorns that won’t let go
are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
war will cease when we refuse to fight
tell me, where is your heart?


i think the silence speaks volumes
now we march to our own drums
they’re only singing what they want to be sung
hate’s become the new anthem
how could you?
when did our veins run numb?
we treat our species like a fucking flood
hate’s becoming our new anthem


the longer i live, i learn that we don’t belong
we’ve taken more than we can give
and you’d do better on your own
the longer i live, i learn that we don’t belong
we’ve taken more than we can give
and you’d do better, better on your own
are we all alone?


tear the borders, break the walls
take us back to when we’re all together as one
taught to love, born to live and let go
tear the borders, break the walls

Wasted Years|Iron Maiden|rock|"
from the coast of gold
across the seven seas
i'm travellin' on
far and wide
but now it seems
i'm just a stranger to myself
and all the things i sometimes do
it isn't me but someone else
i close my eyes, and think of home
another city goes by in the night
ain't it funny how it is
you never miss it 'til it's gone away
and my heart is lying there
and will be 'til my dying day


so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years


too much time on my hands
i got you on my mind
can't ease this pain, so easily
when you can't find the words to say
it's hard to make it through another day
and it makes me wanna cry
and throw my hands up to the sky


so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years




so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand
and realize you're living in the golden years
so understand
don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
face up... make your stand

More Than a Feeling|Boston|rock|"
i looked out this morning and the sun was gone
turned on some music to start my day
i lost myself in a familiar song
i closed my eyes and i slipped away


it's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
i begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'till i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walkin' away


so many people have come and gone
their faces fade as the years go by
yet i still recall as i wander on
as clear as the sun in the summer sky


it's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
i begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'till i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walkin' away




when i'm tired and thinking cold
i hide in my music, forget the day
and dream of a girl i used to know
i closed my eyes and she slipped away

she slipped away


it's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
i begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

What I Got|Sublime|rock|"
early in the mornin', risin' to the street
light me up that cigarette and i'll strap shoes on my feet
got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
got to find a reason why my money's all gone
i got a dalmatian and i can still get high
i can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'cause you might get run over or you might get shot
never start no static, i just get it off my chest
never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
love is what i got, it's within my reach
and the sublime style's still straight from long beach
it all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
try and test that, you're bound to get served
love's what i got, don't start a riot
you feel it when the dance gets hot


lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
and remember that
lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
i got, i got, i got


why i don't cry when my dog runs away
i don't get angry at the bills i have to pay
i don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
living with louie dog's the only way to stay sane
let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me


lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
and remember that
lovin' is what i got
i said remember that

Somebody That I Used To Know|Gotye|rock|"
now and then i think of when we were together
like when you said you felt so happy you could die
told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
but that was love and it's an ache i still remember
you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end, always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well, you said that we would still be friends
but i'll admit that i was glad it was over


but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no, you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know


now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that i'd done
but i don't wanna live that way
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go
and i wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know


but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no, you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know

Born to Run|Bruce Springsteen|rock|"in the day, we sweat it out on the streets
of a runaway american dream
at night, we ride through mansions of glory
in suicide machines
sprung from cages out on highway 9
chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
it's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
we gotta get out while we're young
`cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
yes, girl, we were

wendy let me in, i wanna be your friend
i want to guard your dreams and visions
just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
and strap your hands across my engines
together we could break this trap
we'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`cause baby i'm just a scared and lonely rider
but i gotta find out how it feels
i want to know if love is wild, babe
i want to know if love is real
oh can you show me?

beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
scream down the boulevard
the girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
and the boys try to look so hard
the amusement park rises bold and stark
kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
i wanna die with you, wendy, on the streets tonight
in an everlasting kiss

(1, 2, 3, 4) the highways jammed with broken heroes
on a last chance power drive
everybody's out on the run tonight
but there's no place left to hide
together, wendy, we can live with the sadness
i'll love you with all the madness in my soul
oh, someday girl, i don't know when
we're gonna get to that place
where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
but till then, tramps like us
baby, we were born to run

oh honey, tramps like us
baby, we were born to run
come on with me, tramps like us
baby, we were born to run"
No More Tears|Ozzy Osbourne|rock|"
the light in the window is a crack in the sky
a stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
a levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
the man in the dark will bring another attack
your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
look in the mirror tell me do you think your life's in danger here, yeah


no more tears 


another day passes as the night closes in
the red light goes on to say it's time to begin
i see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
i close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here


no more tears 




so now that it's over can't we just say good-bye?
i'd like to move on and make the most of the night
maybe a kiss before i leave you this way
your lips are so cold, i don't know what else to say
i never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
believe me when i say to you in love i think i'm falling here

Little Dark Age|MGMT|rock|"
breathing in the dark
lying on its side
the ruins of the day
painted with a scar
and the more i straighten out
the less it wants to try
the feelings start to rot
one wink at a time


oh
forgiving who you are
for what you stand to gain
just know that if you hide
it doesn't go away
when you get out of bed
don't end up stranded
horrified with each stone
on the stage
my little dark age


picking through the cards
knowing what's nearby
the carvings on the face
say they find it hard
and the engine's failed again
all limits of disguise
the humor's not the same
coming from denial


oh
i grieve in stereo
the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide
it doesn't go away
if you get out of bed
and find me standing all alone
open-eyed
burn the page
my little dark age


i grieve in stereo
the stereo sounds strange
you know that if it hides
it doesn't go away
if i get out of bed
you'll see me standing all alone
horrified
on the stage
my little dark age


giddy with delight
seeing what's to come
the image of the dead
dead ends in my mind


policemen swear to god
love's seeping from the guns
i know my friends and i
would probably turn and run
if you get out of bed
come find us heading for the bridge
bring a stone
all the rage
my little dark age


i grieve in stereo
the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide
it doesn't go away
if you get out of bed

a policeman knew my name
he said ""you can go sleep at home tonight

i remember throwing punches around

back to the rolling pin

a teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
and buy me a star on the boulevard, it's californication
space may be the final frontier but it's made in a hollywood basement
and cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off station to station?
and alderaan's not far away, it's californication


born and raised by those who praise control of population
well, everybody's been there and i don't mean no vacation
first born unicorn
hardcore soft porn


dream of californication
dream of californication
dream of californication
dream of californication




destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
and earthquakes are to a girl's guitar they're just another good vibration
and tidal waves couldn't save the world from californication


pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're craving
first born unicorn
hardcore soft porn

by now, no doubt that we were heading south

when she whispered ""what was that?""
""the wind, i think 'cause no one else knows where we are""
and that was when she started screamin'
""that's my dad outside the car!""
oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
i guess they knew that she was missing

as i dream about movies
they won't make of me when i'm dead
with an ironclad fist i wake up and
french kiss the morning
while some marching band keeps
its own beat in my head
while we're talking
about all of the things that i long to believe
about love and the truth and
what you mean to me
and the truth is baby you're all that i need...


i want to lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight i sleep on a bed of nails
oh i want to be just as close as the holy ghost is
and lay you down on a bed of roses


well i'm so far away
that each step that i take is on my way home
a king's ransom in dimes i'd given each night
just to see through this payphone
still i run out of time
or it's hard to get through
till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
i'll just close my eyes and whisper
baby blind love is true

the holy ghost is

while my mistress she calls me
to stand in her spotlight again

though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!

don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench


all this time to make amends
what do you do when all your enemies are friends?
now and then i'll try to bend
under pressure wind up snapping in the end

one last thing before i quit
i never wanted any more than i could fit
into my head
i still remember every single word you said
and all the shit that somehow came along with it
still there's one thing that comforts me
since i was always caged and now i'm free


don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench


don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)

man, it's a hot one
like seven inches from the midday sun
i hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
but you stay so cool
my muñequita, my spanish harlem mona lisa
you're my reason for reason, the step in my groove


and if you say this life ain't good enough
i would give my world to lift you up
i could change my life to better suit your mood
because you're so smooth
and it's just like the ocean under the moon
it's the same as the emotion that i get from you
you got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it


i'll tell you one thing
if you would leave it would be a crying shame
in every breath and every word
i hear your name calling me out
out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
you feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
turning you round and round


and if you say this life ain't good enough
i would give my world to lift you up
i could change my life to better suit your mood

take a look around me
taking pages from a magazine
been looking for the answer
ever since we were seventeen
you know the truth can be a weapon
to fight this world of ill intentions
a new answer to the same question
how many times will you learn the same lesson?


i think they got it all wrong
we just gotta hold on
and on, and on, and on


'cause we're gonna be legends
gonna get their attention
what we're doing here ain't just scary
it's about to be legendary
yeah, we're gonna be legends
gonna teach 'em all a lesson
got this feeling in our souls we carry
it's about to be legendary


this is what we came for
and we couldn't want it anymore
we could never turn back now
got to leave it all on the floor
been dreaming of the payoff
through the struggles and the trade-offs
write in truth heading on the way up
tell them the truth but they think it's just made up


i think they got it all wrong
we just gotta hold on
and on, and on, and on


'cause we're gonna be legends
gonna get their attention
what we're doing here ain't just scary
it's about to be legendary
yeah, we're gonna be legends
gonna teach 'em all a lesson
got this feeling in our souls we carry
it's about to be legendary


eventually they're gonna know who's right
to make a stand you got to win the fight
can't stand the heat then just stay out the light
for you might never make it out alive
you gotta live without a compromise
let everybody hear your battle cry


yeah, we're gonna be legends
gonna get their attention
what we're doing here ain't just scary
it's about to be legendary
yeah, we're gonna be legends
gonna teach 'em all a lesson
got this feeling in our souls we carry
it's about to be legendary"

The Sound of Silence|Disturbed|rock|"
hello darkness, my old friend
i've come to talk with you again
because a vision softly creeping
left its seeds while i was sleeping
and the vision that was planted in my brain
still remains within the sound of silence


in restless dreams i walked alone
narrow streets of cobblestone
'neath the halo of a street lamp
i turned my collar to the cold and damp
when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
that split the night and touched the sound of silence


and in the naked light i saw
ten thousand people, maybe more
people talking without speaking
people hearing without listening
people writing songs that voices never shared
and no one dared disturb the sound of silence


""fools"", said i, ""you do not know
silence like a cancer grows
hear my words that i might teach you
take my arms that i might reach you""
but my words like silent raindrops fell
and echoed in the wells of silence


and the people bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
and the sign flashed out its warning
in the words that it was forming
and the sign said ""the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
and tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence"""

sick of all that was, tired of all that is
every hated love i have broken in
sick of fucking up, tired of falling in


and all that i regret
i have before, i will again


it's over now. are you running away?
i come apart as i lie in your way
it's in my blood, let the sky fall down
i won't let go my oblivion


counting every breath, i am my own fear
nothing ever was, nothing ever is
every halo lost, i am worn within
nothing left to hurt, nothing left to live


and all that i regret
i have before, i will again


it's over now. are you running away?
i come apart as i lie in your way
it's in my blood, let the sky fall down
i won't let go my oblivion


face the monster i've become
i'm falling down, hate won't let me go
in the ground we rise to burn
i'm caving in, life won't let me live
forgive my heart

it's in my blood, let the sky fall down

it's nothing but some feelings
that this old dog kicked up
it's been raining since you left me

but without you i give up
now i can't sing a love song
like the way it's meant to be
well, i guess i'm not that good anymore
but baby, that's just me


and i will love you, baby, always
and i'll be there forever and a day, always
i'll be there till the stars don't shine
till the heavens burst and
the words don't rhyme
and i know when i die, you'll be on my mind
and i'll love you, always


now your pictures that you left behind
are just memories of a different life
some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
one that made you have to say goodbye
what i'd give to run my fingers through your hair
to touch your lips, to hold you near
when you say your prayers try to understand
i've made mistakes, i'm just a man
when he holds you close, when he pulls you near
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
i'll wish i was him cause those words are mine
to say to you till the end of time


yeah, i will love you baby, always
and i'll be there forever and a day, always


if you told me to cry for you
i could
if you told me to die for you
i would
take a look at my face
there's no price i won't pay
to say these words to you

well, there ain't no luck
in these loaded dice
but baby if you give me just one more try
we can pack up our old dreams
and our old lives
we'll find a place where the sun still shines


and i will love you, baby, always
and i'll be there forever and a day, always
i'll be there till the stars don't shine
till the heavens burst and
the words don't rhyme
and i know when i die, you'll be on my mind

hold me up, underneath
this heavy burden


there's a halo in the distance
salvation's barely out of reach


torn apart like the brokenhearted
up in smoke with the fire we started
misery loves company
i don't need anyone
smash it up like there's no tomorrow
leave me here with the fear and sorrow
misery loves company
i don't need anyone


tied up to a heart of stone
i screamed into a microphone
i burned the bridge, so i won't find my way home

lay with me, i can't sleep

when i'm broken

salvation's barely out of reach


torn apart like the brokenhearted
up in smoke with the fire we started

fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
in the dark awake, and you're not around
and the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
fifteen times a day when you check your phone
and i won't be there and you're all alone
'cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
left to find our way through a hitchcock film
in an empty bed with an hour to kill
'cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)


torn apart like the brokenhearted
up in smoke with the fire we started
misery loves company
i don't need anyone
smash it up like there's no tomorrow

and when you're lost in the darkest of hours
take a moment and tell me who you see
won't tell you who not to be


now you know i am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(and you know it's right)
i am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
know me by name, shepherd of fire


disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
pardon your mind from the chains of the divine
make way, the shepherd of fire


through the ages of time
i've been known for my hate
but i'm a dealer of simple choices
for me its never too late


i am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(and you know it's right)
i am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
i am your wrath, i am your guilt, i am your lust!
(and you know it's right)
i am your law, i am your scar, i am your trust
know me by name, shepherd of fire"

those he plays never suspect
he doesn't play for the money he wins
he don't play for respect

the hidden law of a probable outcome
the numbers lead a dance


i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean money for this art
but that's not the shape of my heart


he may play the jack of diamonds
he may lay the queen of spades
he may conceal a king in his hand
while the memory of it fades

The Come Up|Shaman's Harvest|rock|"
i tried praying the sun down
i screamed at the mountain
thought it might fall down at my feet
but i felt the rage
it was changing direction, oh no
pushin' and pullin' on me
it made me believe in an unseen enemy
creatures that seethe in the dark
gnashin' their teeth
how can you breathe
when your fear eclipses the fire?


can't you see i'm fallin'?
i could use a hand getting off of the floor
don't you hear me callin'?
i can't fight alone anymore


lets get this mojo on the come up
get satisfied, ain't nobody lookin' for sympathy
stop wastin' time and get back on the grind
even king kong got nothin' on me
once i could see i was my own enemy
my demons pushin' me to the dark
it's in my eyes, how far i'd rise
with my fears burning in a pyre


can't you see i'm fallin'?
i could use a hand getting off of the floor
don't you hear me callin'?
i can't fight alone anymore


you can't pray the sun down as long as it's up
sometimes treading water
feels like too much
focus on the callin'
come on, you gotta run
don't you crawl anymore

in the white room with black curtains near the station
black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment

i'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

you said no strings could secure you at the station
platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
i walked into such a sad time at the station
as i walked out, felt my own need just beginning

i'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
lie with you where the shadows run from themselves



at the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
consolation for the old wound now forgotten
yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
she's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

i'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

wake up to a cloudy day
dark rolls in, and it starts to rain
staring out to the cage-like walls
time goes by and the shadows crawl
crushing candy, crushing pills
got no job, mom pays my bills
texting exes, get my fill
sweating bullets, netflix chills
world's out there singing the blues
twenty more dead on the evening news
think to myself: ""really, what's the use?""
i'm just like you, i was born to lose


why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
when all i want's to feel numb
but the medication's all gone
why, oh, why does god hate me?
when all i want's to get high
and forget this so-called life


i am so frickin' bored
nothing to do today
i guess i'll sit around and medicate (medicate)
i am so frickin' bored
nothing to do today
i guess i'll sit around and medicate (medicate)


can't wait to feel better than i ever will
attack that shit like a kid on benadryl
chase it down with a hopeful smile
hate myself, i can go for miles
they say family's all you need
someone to trust who can help you breathe
inhale that drug, but you start to choke
you fall on the outs of an inside joke


why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
when all i want's to feel numb
but the medication's all gone
why, oh, why does god hate me?
cause i've seen enough of it, heard enough of it, felt enough of it
had enough of it!

superman is a hero
but only when his mind is clear, though
he needs that fix like the rest of us
so he's got no fear when he saves that bus
all the stars in the hollywood hills
snapchat live while they pop them pills
all those flavors of the rainbow
too bad that shit don't work though


your friends are high right now
your parents are high right now
that hot chick's high right now
that cop is high right now
the president's high right now
your priest is high right now
everyone's high as fuck right now

i try to tell that to this pen

she packs her bags leaves for a different world

storming through the party like my name was el niño
when i'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an el camino
as a kid, i was a skid and no one knew me by name
trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came


i know i'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
never going, never showing up when we had to
attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
i'm sick of always hearing ""act your age""


i don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity
and back down


because you don't
know us at all we laugh when old people fall
but what would you expect with a conscience so small
heavy metal and mullets it's how we were raised
maiden and priest were the gods that we praised


'cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and
cutting people down is just a minor offense then
it's none of your concern, i guess i'll never learn
i'm sick of being told to wait my turn


i don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity
and back down


don't count on me, to let you know when
don't count on me, i'll do it again
don't count on me, it's the point you're missing
don't count on me, cause i'm not listening


well i'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
back packed and i don't give a shit about nothing
you be standing on the corner talking all that kerfluffin'
but you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
then if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
you're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
i like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
the doctor said my mom should have had an abortion


i don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity
and back down

waste my time with them
casualty of society
waste my time again

up the broken pieces of yesterday's life

somewhere a king has no wife

and shine their emptiness down on my bed
the tiny island sags downstream
'cos the life that they lived is dead

i am a little bit of loneliness
a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints, but i can't help the fact
that everyone can see these scars

i am what i want you to want
what i want you to feel
but, it's like no matter what i do
i can't convince you to just believe this is real


so, i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not

i can't feel the way i did, before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored

don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored


i am a little bit insecure
a little unconfident
'cause you don't understand, i do what i can
but sometimes, i don't make sense

i am what you never wanna say
but, i've never had a doubt
it's like no matter what i do, i can't convince you
for once, just to hear me out


so, i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not

you ask if i'll grow to be a wise man, well i ask if i'll grow old
you ask me if i've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
well, i've seen love come, i've seen it shot down, i've seen it die in vain

just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices


before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
remember it's just different from what you've seen

Black Hole Sun|Soundgarden|rock|"
in my eyes, indisposed
in disguises no one knows
hides the face, lies the snake
the sun in my disgrace
boiling heat, summer stench
'neath the black the sky looks dead
call my name through the cream
and i'll hear you scream again


black hole sun, won't you come
and wash away the rain?
black hole sun, won't you come?
won't you come? won't you come?


stuttering, cold and damp
steal the warm wind tired friend
times are gone for honest men
and sometimes far too long for snakes
in my shoes, a walking sleep
and my youth i pray to keep
heaven send hell away
no one sings like you anymore


black hole sun,  won't you come
and wash away the rain?
black hole sun, won't you come?
won't you come?
black hole sun,  won't you come
and wash away the rain?

won't you come?
black hole sun, black hole sun
won't you come?

hang my head, drown my fear
till you all just disappear

my bags outside, yelling, ""get the hell away!
you're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
and you can't never change all the things that you did!""
that's when i knew it, it wouldn't last
you never get away, when you're running from the past


i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity


i'm a broken man, i'm full of sin
i'm sick of all this hell that i'm living in
and i can't escape it, this is how it feels
when you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
you tore me down, wished that i was dead
said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
but when i push away, you only pull me closer
it's only over when we both wanna say it's over
i gotta change this is not who i am
i wanna start over wanna try this again
you're everything i need, everything i'm not
so pull the trigger, give me one more shot


i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity


you love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
you lifted me up just to watch as you broke me
you promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
no matter what you say, i don't know truth from the lies
i helped you up, like i always do
i forgave you for your sins and i carried you through them
no matter how hard we fought, we always knew
you will bleed for me, and i will bleed for you


fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity


i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity
i will fly into outer space
i float away, but you're my gravity
i will die to love another day
we rise again and lose our gravity


baby, we can float away"
A Reason to Fight|Disturbed|rock|"
the image in your eyes
reflecting the pain that has taken you
i hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
from what's ailing you


i won't give up, so don't give in
you've fallen down, but you can rise again
so don't give up


when the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
and it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
when you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
when there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight


lost in your world of lies
i find it so hard to believe in you
can it be real this time
or just a part of this game that we're playing through?


i won't give up, so don't give in
you've fallen down, but you will rise again
i won't give up


when the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
and it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
when you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
when there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight


don't let it take your soul
look at me, take control
we're going to fight this war
this is nothing worth dying for


are you ready to begin?
this is a battle that we are gonna win


when you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
when there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason

Smoke On The Water|Deep Purple|rock|"

on the lake geneva shoreline
to make records with a mobile
we didn't have much time
but frank zappa and the mothers
were at the best place around
but some stupid with a flare gun
burned the place to the ground


smoke on the water
(and fire in the sky)
smoke on the water


they burned down the gambling house
it died with an awful sound
funky claude was running in and out
pulling kids out the ground
when it all was over
we had to find another place
but swiss time was running out
it seemed that we would lose the race


smoke on the water
(and fire in the sky)
smoke on the water




we ended up at the grand hotel
it was empty cold and bare
but with the rolling-truck-stones-thing just outside
making our music there
with a few red lights, a few old beds
we made a place to sweat
no matter what we get out of this
i know i know we'll never forget

rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while

a little anxious when it's dark


fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there




have you run your fingers down the wall
and have you felt your neck skin crawl
when you're searching for the light?


sometimes when you're scared to take a look
at the corner of the room
you've sensed that something's watching you


fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there


have you ever been alone at night
thought you heard footsteps behind
and turned around and no-one's there?


and as you quicken up your pace
you find it hard to look again
because you're sure there's someone there


fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that something's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark

so where will we go when the waters threaten to wash us away?
and all of our sons and our daughters wilt in the heat of the day?
i feel the sun draw nearer, i feel the sea start to rise
who's looking back in the mirror? why are they closing -
why are they closing their eyes?

hit 'em right between the eyes

when you walk away, nothing more to say
see the lightning in your eyes
see 'em running for their lives


slowly out of line
and drifting closer in your sight
so play it out, i'm wide-awake
it's a scene about me

there's something in your way
and now someone is gonna pay
and if you can't get what you want
well, it's all because of me


now dance, fucker, dance

and no one even knew

The Anthem|Good Charlotte|rock|"
yeah
here we go


it's a new day but it all feels old
""it's a good life"" – that's what i'm told
but every day, it all just feels the same
at my high school it felt more to me
like a jail cell, a penitentiary
my time spent there – it only made me see
that i don't ever wanna be like you
i don't wanna do the things you do
i'm never gonna to hear the words you say and...


i don't ever wanna– i don't ever wanna be you
don't wanna be just like you
uh, what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
you, don't wanna be you


""go to college or university
get a real job"" – that's what they said to me
but i could never live the way they want
i'm going to get by and just do my time
outta step while they all get in line
i'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
do you really wanna to be like them?
do you really wanna be another trend?
do you wanna be part of that crowd? 'cause...


i don't ever wanna– i don't ever wanna be you
don't wanna be just like you
uh, what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
you, don't wanna be you


shake it once, that's fine
shake it twice, that's okay
shake it three times
you're playing with your self again
(you, don't wanna be just like you)
what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
now you can feel me, sing if you're with me
you, don't wanna be just like you
(just like you)
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
now you can feel me, sing if you're with me

buried alive inside of my own grave

nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what i'd become

and if i give it a twist
something to hold when i lose my grip
will i find something in there?

American Pie|Don McLean|rock|"
a long, long time ago...
i can still remember
how that music used to make me smile
and i knew if i had my chance
that i could make those people dance
and, maybe, they’d be happy for a while
but february made me shiver
with every paper i’d deliver
bad news on the doorstep;
i couldn’t take one more step
i can’t remember if i cried
when i read about his widowed bride
but something touched me deep inside
the day the music died


so bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
singing, ""this’ll be the day that i die
""this’ll be the day that i die.""


did you write the book of love
and do you have faith in god above
if the bible tells you so?
do you believe in rock ’n' roll
can music save your mortal soul
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
well, i know that you’re in love with him
`cause i saw you dancin’ in the gym
you both kicked off your shoes
man, i dig those rhythm and blues
i was a lonely teenage broncin’ buck
with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
but i knew i was out of luck
the day the music died
i started singing


bye, bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
singing, ""this’ll be the day that i die
""this’ll be the day that i die.""


now for ten years we’ve been on our own
and moss grows fat on a rollin’ stone
but that’s not how it used to be
when the jester sang for the king and queen
in a coat he borrowed from james dean
and a voice that came from you and me
oh, and while the king was looking down
the jester stole his thorny crown
the courtroom was adjourned;
no verdict was returned
and while lennon read a book on marx
the quartet practiced in the park
and we sang dirges in the dark
the day the music died
we were singing


bye, bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
singing, ""this’ll be the day that i die
""this’ll be the day that i die.""


helter skelter in a summer swelter
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
eight miles high and falling fast
it landed foul on the grass
the players tried for a forward pass
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
now the half-time air was sweet perfume
while the sergeants played a marching tune
we all got up to dance
oh, but we never got the chance!
`cause the players tried to take the field;
the marching band refused to yield
do you recall what was revealed
the day the music died?
we started singing


bye, bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
singing, ""this’ll be the day that i die
""this’ll be the day that i die.""


oh, and there we were all in one place
a generation lost in space
with no time left to start again
so come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!
jack flash sat on a candlestick
cause fire is the devil’s only friend
oh, and as i watched him on the stage
my hands were clenched in fists of rage
no angel born in hell
could break that satan’s spell
and as the flames climbed high into the night
to light the sacrificial rite
i saw satan laughing with delight
the day the music died
we were singing


bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
singing, ""this’ll be the day that i die
""this’ll be the day that i die.""


i met a girl who sang the blues
and i asked her for some happy news
but she just smiled and turned away
i went down to the sacred store
where i’d heard the music years before
but the man there said the music wouldn’t play
and in the streets: the children screamed
the lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
but not a word was spoken;
the church bells all were broken
and the three men i admire most:
the father, son, and the holy ghost
they caught the last train for the coast
the day the music died
and they were singing


and there i stood alone and afraid
i dropped to my knees and there i prayed
and i promised him everything i could give
if only he would make the music live
and he promised it would live once more
but this time one would equal four
and in five years four had come to mourn
and the music was reborn


bye-bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
singing, ""this’ll be the day that i die
""this’ll be the day that i die.""
they were singing
bye-bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
singing, ""this’ll be the day that i die"""

gathering speed as we head down the runway

move to their blindsides and firing again

ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
heading straight for them i press down my guns

Song On Fire|Nickelback|rock|"
the first words that come out
and i can see this song will be about you
i can't believe that i can breathe without you
but all i need to do is carry on
the next line i write down
and there's a tear that falls between the pages
i know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
but it depends which one i'm standing on


i write lines down, then rip them up
describing love can't be this tough


i could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
i could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
play it for the world, but it won't mean much
unless i sing this song to you


i'm dying to show you
this could end happily ever after
there doesn't ever have to be disaster
and all you have to do is sing along


i write lines down, then rip them up
impossible describing love


i could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
i could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
play it for the world, but it won't mean much
unless i sing this song to you


i could set this song on fire
sing this song to you
i could set this song on fire


light this old guitar on fire, i'd still hear the notes
drown the melody in water, i'd still hear its ghost
sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
play it for the world, but it won't mean much

Is There Anybody out There?|Machine Head|rock|"is there anybody out there?

come on
come on

is there anybody there?
come on
here's a little something

i was born as a bastard, no father, no master
a shadow in silence left searching for answers
put up for adoption and left with no option
another kid fostered to fester, forgotten
take a look into these desperate eyes
as they’re cast into the wretched hive
but i ain’t going down alone

is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i’m choking on these words and i can’t breathe

come on
come on
come on
is there anybody there?
come on
come on
lemme say this

now i stand as a father, to men with no honor
ashamed of the racists i used to call brothers
'cause no flag can mean bravery
when bloodied by slavery
the rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior
and the sickening feeling in the air
is the fear to speak that no one dares
so will i stand here all alone?

is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i’m choking on these words and i can’t breathe

live my life like i’ll die tonight
dream like i’ll live forever
live my life like i’ll die tonight
dream like i’ll live forever

(is there anybody out there?)
i have roared at the world for years
(is there anybody out there?)
doesn’t anybody hear me?
(is there anybody out there?)
this burden suffered, i’ve paid the cost
(is there anybody out there?)
not all who wander are lost

is there anybody
is there anybody
is there anybody

is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i’m choking on these words and i can’t breathe

the bang of a slamming door?

Re-Education (Through Labor)|Rise Against|rock|"
to the sound of a heartbeat pounding away
to the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
we toss and turn but don't sleep
each breath we take makes us thieves
like causes without rebels
just talk but promise nothing else


we crawl on our knees for you
under a sky no longer blue
we sweat all day long for you
but we sow seeds to see us through
cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
we wait to reap what we are due


to the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
and the blare of the sirens combing the streets
chased down like dogs we run from
your grasp until the sun comes up


we crawl on our knees for you
under a sky no longer blue
we sweat all day long for you
but we sow seeds to see us through
cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
look now at what they've done to you


white needles buried in the red
the engine roars and then it gives
but never dies
cause we don't live
we just survive
on the scraps that you throw away


i won't crawl on my knees for you
i won't believe the lies that hide the truth
i won't sweat one more drop for you
cause we are the rust upon your gears
we are the insect in your ears
we crawl
we crawl
we crawl
all over you

our days are precious and so few
we all reap what we are due
under this sky no longer blue
we bring the dawn long overdue

just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion

lay your weary head to rest

masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man, well
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set a course for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say


carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

carry on, nothing equals the splendor

A Horse with No Name|America|rock|"
on the first part of the journey
i was looking at all the life
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings
the first thing i met was a fly with a buzz
and the sky with no clouds
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
but the air was full of sound


i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can’t remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
la, la, la lala la la la, la, la
la, la, la lala la la la, la, la

after two days in the desert sun
my skin began to turn red
after three days in the desert fun
i was looking at a river bed
and the story it told of a river that flowed
made me sad to think it was dead


you see i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can’t remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
la, la ...

{bridge}
after nine days i let the horse run free
'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings
the ocean is a desert with its life underground
and a perfect disguise above
under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love


(you see) i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can’t remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

who was that inside you that made me feel so gone?

The Trooper|Iron Maiden|rock|"
you'll take my life but i'll take yours too
you'll fire your musket but i'll run you through
so when you're waiting for the next attack
you'd better stand there's no turning back
the bugle sounds the charge begins
but on this battlefield no one wins
the smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
as i plunge on into certain death


oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


the horse he sweats with fear we break to run
the mighty roar of the russian guns
and as we race towards the human wall
the screams of pain as my comrades fall
we hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
and the russians fire another round
we get so near yet so far away
we won't live to fight another day


oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh




we get so close, near enough to fight
when a russian gets me in his sights
he pulls the trigger and i feel the blow
a burst of rounds takes my horse below
and as i lay there gazing at the sky
my body's numb and my throat is dry
and as i lay forgotten and alone
without a tear i draw my parting groan


oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh"

on a dark desert highway
cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colitas
rising up through the air
up ahead in the distance
i saw a shimmering light
my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
i had to stop for the night
there she stood in the doorway
i heard the mission bell
and i was thinking to myself
""this could be heaven or this could be hell""
then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
there were voices down the corridor
i thought i heard them say


""welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
such a lovely face
plenty of room at the hotel california
any time of year (any time of year)
you can find it here""


her mind is tiffany-twisted
she got the mercedes benz
she got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
she calls friends
how they dance in the courtyard
sweet summer sweat
some dance to remember
some dance to forget
so i called up the captain
""please bring me my wine""
he said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
and still those voices are calling from far away
wake you up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say


""welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
such a lovely face
they living it up at the hotel california
what a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
bring your alibis""


mirrors on the ceiling
the pink champagne on ice
and she said: ""we are all just prisoners here
of our own device""
and in the master's chambers
they gathered for the feast
they stab it with their steely knives
but they just can't kill the beast
last thing i remember, i was
running for the door
i had to find the passage back
to the place i was before
""relax,"" said the night man
""we are programmed to receive
you can check out any time you like
but you can never leave!""

life's been good to me so far


my maserati does 185
i lost my license, now i don't drive
i have a limo, ride in the back
i lock the doors in case i'm attacked

i'm making records, my fans they can't wait

i can't complain but sometimes i still do
life's been good to me so far


i go to parties sometimes until 4

Over The Hills And Far Away|Gary Moore|rock|"they came for him one winter's night
arrested, he was bound
they said there'd been a robbery
his pistol had been found

they marched him to the station house
he waited till the dawn
and as they led him to the dock
he knew that he'd been wronged
""you stand accused of robbery,""
he heard the bailiff say
he knew without an alibi
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

over the hills and far away
for ten long years he'll count the days
over the mountains and the seas
a prisoner's life for him there'll be

he knew that it would cost him dear
but yet he dare not say
just where he'd been that fateful night
a secret it must stay
he had to fight back tears of rage
his heart beat like a drum
for with the wife of his best friend
he spent his final night of freedom

over the hills and far away
he swears he will return one day
far from the mountains and the seas
back in her arms again he'll be
over the hills and far away

over the hills and
over the hills and
over the hills and far away

each night within his prison cell
he looks out through the bars
he reads the letters that she wrote
one day he'll know the taste of freedom

over the hills and far away
she prays he will return one day
as sure as the rivers reach the seas
back in his arms again she'll be

over the hills and far away
he swears he will return one day
as sure as the river reach the seas
back in his arms is where she'll be

over the hills and far away

years too late, she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me


i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is ""are you mine?""
well, are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine? woah, ah


i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape, lost track of time and space

wanna hear her say is ""are you mine?""

hear the dj say love's a game of easy come and easy go
but i wonder does he know
has he ever felt like this

i can still feel so much pain
like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
but the scar, that scar remains


i know i could have saved a love that night
if i'd known what to say
instead of makin' love
we both made our separate ways


and now i hear you found somebody new
and that i never meant that much to you

go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track

the lightning all around me
i remembered each flash
as time began to blur
like a startling sign
that fate had finally found me
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve


so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
give me reason
to fill this hole
connect this space between
let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
across this new divide


there was nothing in sight
but memories left abandoned
there was nowhere to hide
the ashes fell like snow
and the ground caved in
between where we were standing
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve


so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
across this new divide


in every loss in every lie
in every truth that you deny
and each regret and each goodbye
was a mistake too great to hide
and your voice was all i heard

workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads

hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
the last three days the rain was unstoppable
it was always cold, no sunshine

i hear the drums echoing tonight
but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
she's coming in, 12:30 flight
the moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
i stopped an old man along the way
hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
he turned to me as if to say
""hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""


it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never have


the wild dogs cry out in the night
as they grow restless longing for some solitary company
i know that i must do what's right
as sure as kilimanjaro rises like olympus above the serengeti
i seek to cure what's deep inside
frightened of this thing that i've become

about where we go when we go

but then i find myself in bed
lost inside my head again
running over everything
the voices, they are deafening
out from the noise
i hear that familiar voice
he says ""life is the great unknown""

better jump, run

reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?

the evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

the night was black, was no use holding back
cause i just had to see, was someone watching me?
in the mist, dark figures move and twist
was all this for real or just some kind of hell?

hell and fire was spawned to be released


torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
as they start to cry, hands held to the sky
in the night, the fires burning bright
the ritual has begun, satan's work is done


666 the number of the beast
sacrifice is going on tonight





this can't go on, i must inform the law

riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
galloping hard on the plains
chasing the redskins back to their holes
fighting them at their own game
murder for freedom the stab in the back
women and children are cowards attack


run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives


soldier blue in the barren wastes
hunting and killing's a game
raping the women and wasting the men
the only good injuns are tame
selling them whiskey and taking their gold
enslaving the young and destroying the old


run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives




run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives
run to the hills, run for your lives"

Bleed It Out|Linkin Park|rock|"
yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
hand grenade pins in every line
throw 'em up and let something shine
going out of my fucking mind

filthy mouth, no excuse
find a new place to hang this noose
string me up from atop these roofs
knot it tight so i won't get loose

truth is, you can stop and stare
bled myself out and no one cares
dug the trench out, laid down there
with a shovel up out of reach, somewhere

yeah, someone pour it in
make it a dirt dance floor, again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in


i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away

go, stop the show
choppy words and a sloppy flow
shotgun opera, lock and load
cock it back and then watch it go

mama, help me, i've been cursed
death is rolling in every verse
candy paint on his brand new hearse
can't contain him, he knows he works

fuck, this hurts, i won't lie
doesn't matter how hard i try
half the words don't mean a thing
and i know that i won't be satisfied

so why try ignoring him?
make it a dirt dance floor again
say your prayers and stomp it out

the walls you hide behind

because i know you're lost when you run away
into the same black holes and black mistakes
taking all my will just to run alone
when are you coming home?

even if the sky does fall
even if they take it all
there's no pain that i won't go through
even if i have to die for you

and when all the fires burn
when everything is overturning
there's no thing that i won’t go through
even if i have to die for you

one day the earth will open wide
and i’ll follow you inside
cause the only hell i know is without you
some day when galaxies collide
we'll be lost on different skies
i will send my rocket ship to find you

because i know you're lost when you run away
into the same black holes and black mistakes
taking all my will just to run alone
until i bring you home

even if the sky does fall
even if they take it all
there's no pain that i won't go through
even if i have to die for you

when everything is overturning
there's no thing that i won’t go through
even if i have to die for you

and if the sun grows cold for you along the way
and if the stars don’t line to light the way
and when you fall away and crash back down below
i’ll search the skies for you and i’ll follow
in your afterglow
and i’ll bring you home

even if the sky does fall
even if they take it all

the lover of life's not a sinner
the ending is just a beginner
the closer you get to the meaning
the sooner you'll know that you're dreaming


so, it's on and on and on
oh, it's on and on and on
it goes on and on and on
heaven and hell, i can tell
fool, fool! oh, yeah-yeah!


well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
for every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
love can be seen as the answer
but nobody bleeds for the dancer


and it's on and on, on and on and on...




they say that life's a carousel
spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
the world is full of kings and queens
who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
it's heaven and hell, oh well
and they'll tell you black is really white
the moon is just the sun at night
and when you walk in golden halls
you get to keep the gold that falls
it's heaven and hell, oh no!
fool, fool!
you've got to bleed for the dancer!
fool, fool!
look for the answer!
fool, fool, fool!

Lights Out|Royal Blood|rock|"
every time i'm with it alone
it picks me up
you just send me down
i can feel it rushing under my skin
you're a cage won't you let me in?
on my toes
lock the door
pretty face
through the walls
don't know if i'd be so sure again


my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out
you're not so hard to forget
with all the lights out


every time i'm stuck in the ground
spin me round, won't you spin me round
you're a void, a crack in the mirror
see me now, if you could see me now
you slipped through
the night
then walked out
skin tight
but you don't matter that much to me
no you don't matter that much to me


my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out

just turn the lights out

The Rover|Interpol|rock|"
come and see me and maybe you'll die
but i can keep you in artwork, the fluid kind
that's enough for excitements today
prostrated faded, it's pay-to-play


come and see me, yeah, maybe you'll try
i've been holding these pyros til they could fly
open up and enlighten again
enjoy the skyline, it's an incremental end


""walk in on your own feet""

""it's my way or they all leave""
says the rover
(ooooh, ooooh)

Sabotage|Beastie Boys|rock|"
i can't stand it, i know you planned it
i'm-a set it straight, this watergate
i can't stand rockin' when i'm in here
cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
so while you sit back and wonder why
i got this fuckin' thorn in my side
oh my god, it's a mirage
i'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage


so, so, so, so listen up, cause you can't say nothin'
you'll shut me down with a push of your button
but, yo, i'm out and i'm gone
i'll tell you now, i keep it on and on


cause what you see, you might not get
and we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
i'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage


whhhhhyyyyyy
(our backs are now against the wall)


listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all y'all, it's a sabotage


i can't stand it, i know you planned it
i'm-a set it straight, this watergate
but i can't stand rockin' when i'm in this place
because i feel disgrace because you're all in my face
but make no mistakes and switch up my channel
i'm buddy rich when i fly off the handle
what could it be -- it's a mirage
you're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage"

How to Save a Life|The Fray|rock|"
step one, you say we need to talk
he walks, you say sit down; it's just a talk
he smiles politely back at you
you stare politely right on through
some sort of window to your right
as he goes left and you stay right
between the lines of fear and blame
you begin to wonder why you came


where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life


let him know that you know best
'cause after all, you do know best
try to slip past his defense
without granting innocence
lay down a list of what is wrong
the things you've told him all along
and pray to god he hears you
and pray to god he hears you, and


where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life


as he begins to raise his voice
you lower yours and grant him one last choice
drive until you lose the road
or break with the ones you've followed
he will do one of two things
he will admit to everything
or he'll say he's just not the same
and you'll begin to wonder why you came


where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life


where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness

Streets of Philadelphia|Bruce Springsteen|rock|"i was bruised and battered, i couldn't tell what i felt
i was unrecognizable to myself
i saw my reflection in a window, i didn't know my own face
oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
on the streets of philadelphia

i walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
i heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
at night i could hear the blood in my veins
it was just as black and whispering as the rain
on the streets of philadelphia

ain't no angel gonna greet me
it's just you and i my friend
my clothes don't fit me no more
i walked a thousand miles
just to slip this skin

the night has fallen, i'm lyin' awake
i can feel myself fading away
so receive me brother with your faithless kiss

i am a vessel of invincibility
i cannot leave this undecided
stepping down to battle another day

remember me for all time
this determination is a vital part of me
surrender now, or be counted
with the endless masses that i will defeat


come on bring it, don't sing it
better believe it

broken down, 'til your hope has died
beat down, 'til the victory is mine
stand up and show me some pride
and now, are you ready?


i'm one with the warrior, inside
my dominance can't be denied
your entire world will turn
into a battlefield, tonight

as i look upon you
through the warriors eyes, now
i can see the fear that will
ensure my victory, this time


i can't be told to compromise this
they'll never doubt the body lying at my feet
a most formidable reminder
they will speak my name for eternity

i have no need of any guidance
i am a weapon, powerful beyond belief
seen through the warriors eyes
i never need to question how to defeat you


come on bring it, don't sing it
better believe it

broken down, 'til your hope has died
beat down, 'til the victory is mine
stand up and show me some pride
and now, are you ready?


i'm one with the warrior, inside
my dominance can't be denied
your entire world will turn
into a battlefield, tonight

as i look upon you
through the warriors eyes, now
i can see the fear that will
ensure my victory, this time


you can't hide, now
i am the warrior
so decide, now
how they’ll remember you

do not hide, now
act like a warrior
show your pride, now
solidify your place in time


i'm one with the warrior, inside
my dominance can’t be denied
your entire world will turn
into a battlefield, tonight

as i look upon you
through the warriors eyes, now
i can see the fear that will
ensure my victory, this time

Be Yourself|Audioslave|rock|"
someone falls to pieces sleeping all alone
someone kills the pain
spinning in the silence
she finally drifts away
someone gets excited in a chapel yard
catches a bouquet
another lays a dozen
white roses on a grave


yeah and to be yourself is all that you can do
hey, to be yourself is all that you can do


someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
separate or united, healthy or insane


to be yourself is all that you can do
to be yourself is all that you can do
to be yourself is all that you can do
to be yourself is all that you can do


and even when you've paid enough
been pulled apart or been held up
every single memory of the good or bad
faces of love
don't lose any sleep tonight
i'm sure everything will end up alright
you may win or lose


but to be yourself is all that you can do
to be yourself is all that you can do


to be yourself is all that you can do
to be yourself is all that you can do
to be yourself is all that you can do
to be yourself is all that you can do


be yourself is all that you can

Radar Love|Golden Earring|rock|"
i’ve been driving all night
my hand’s wet on the wheel
there’s a voice in my head that drives my heel
it’s my baby calling
says ""i need you here""
and it’s half past four and i’m shifting gear


when she’s lonely and the longing gets too much
she sends a cable coming in from above
don’t need no phone at all
we’ve got a thing that’s called radar love
we’ve got a wave in the air
radar love


the radio’s playing some forgotten song
brenda lee’s ""coming on strong""
the road has got me hypnotized
and i’m speeding into a new sunrise


when i get lonely and i’m sure i’ve had enough
she sends her comfort coming in from above
don’t need no letter at all
we’ve got a thing that’s called radar love
we’ve got a line in the sky
radar love


no more speed i’m almost there
gotta keep cool now gotta take care
last car to pass here i go
and the line of cars drove down real slow
and the radio played that forgotten song
brenda lee’s ""coming on strong""
and the newsman sang his same song
one more radar love is gone


when i get lonely and i’m sure i’ve had enough
she sends her comfort coming in from above
don’t need no letter at all
we’ve got a thing that’s called radar love
we’ve got a line in the sky

The River|Bruce Springsteen|rock|"


i come from down in the valley
where, mister, when you're young
they bring you up to do like your daddy done
me and mary we met in high school
when she was just seventeen
we'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green


we'd go down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
oh, down to the river we'd ride


then i got mary pregnant
and man, that was all she wrote
and for my nineteenth birthday i got a union card and a wedding coat
we went down to the courthouse
and the judge put it all to rest
no wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
no flowers, no wedding dress


that night we went down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
oh, down to the river we did ride
ah-yah




i got a job working construction for the johnstown company
but lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
now all them things that seemed so important
well, mister, they vanished right into the air
now i just act like i don't remember
mary acts like she don't care


but i remember us riding in my brother's car
her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
at night on them banks i'd lie awake
and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
now those memories come back to haunt me
they haunt me like a curse
is a dream a lie if it don't come true
or is it something worse


that sends me down to the river
though i know the river is dry
that sends me down to the river tonight
ah-yah-yah
down to the river

oh, down to the river we ride

why can't you see we'll be alright?

nothing disappears
even the pain we've been through
but all i need is here
don't wanna live without you


all we need is nothing more
when everything simplifies
you and i need nothing more

spitting out pieces of his broken luck

leg hurting bad

december's foggy freeze?
when the ice that
clings on to your beard was
screaming agony (hey!)
and you snatch your rattling last breaths
with deep-sea-diver sounds
and the flowers bloom like
madness in the spring

she is so beautiful
with flowers in her hair
her perfume smells like summer air
and her lips are the sweetest like honey and milk
and her skin white like cocaine but soft as silk
and her hair is as black as a reservoir

at midnight and still and it takes me so far
so far that i don't believe that there is an end
but if there is i will climb and dive in again

we picked daisies and i made a chain
asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
and if this isn't love don't show me the truth
i said if this isn't love
i'm gonna need some

tiny wild flowers all tied in your hair
like stars in the sky just floating there
a constellation gorgeous and new
you called it the lovers
i believed it was true

and all of a sudden you rose from our nest
no longer felt love
i felt sorrow instead
as you walked you combed out your hair
and all the flowers fell like birds through the air

we picked daisies and i made a chain
asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
and if this isn't love don't show me the truth
i said if this isn't love
i'm gonna need some

like stars in the sky
falling to earth
the lovers are dead
the lovers are cursed

asleep in the grass, both feeling insane

Can't Fight This Feeling|REO Speedwagon|rock|"
oh i can't fight this feeling any longer
and yet i'm still afraid to let it flow
what started out as friendship, has grown stronger
i only wish i had the strength to let it show
i tell myself that i can't hold out forever
i said there is no reason for my fear
cause i feel so secure when we're together
you give my life direction
you make everything so clear


and even as i wander
i'm keeping you in sight
you're a candle in the window
on a cold, dark winter's night

Through It All|From Ashes to New|rock|"
there's not a day that passes by, the pain has not amassed inside
it's breaking me down to the ground, it's like i crashed and died
it's hard to leave your past behind, especially when you're last in line
and half the time it acts like vines and wraps inside my fragile mind
hiding in plain view, it seems the same old shit i choose between
taking who i used to be and keeping it subdued beneath
close to dead and losing me, you took a chance and you believed
so did i, i let you lead and grabbed the line you threw to me
and through it all


you saved me, you made me
and through it all, you changed me forever
you love me, you hate me
and through it all, you changed me forever


you've given me a chance to change, helped me in ways i can't explain
i'll never understand the way you took my hand with no dismay
now i'm who i am today, and that's the man i plan to stay
but can't escape, i can't evade, you stranded me and ran away
why'd you do it? why'd you leave? why'd you help me find my feet?
why'd you guide me blindingly then turn and say goodbye to me?
all this time i tried to be the person you applied to me
this lie you feed that i'd succeed is why i'm me, a dying breed


you saved me, you made me
and through it all you changed me forever
you love me, you hate me
and through it all you changed me forever


through it all you changed me, i'm not the same me
for better or for worse, this person that you made me
through it all you changed me, i'm not the same me
for better or for worse, you changed me forever


it's killing me down deep within, it makes me strain to breathe again
all this pain i keep it in if it's the end where'd we begin
it's so hard to comprehend where we are is where we end
let's make believe, let's just pretend, you don't hate me and want me dead
what you said stays in my head, an unrelenting discontent
it torments me to no extent, entrenches me just like cement
it makes no sense what's your intent, bled for me then fled instead
you never meant to be content, fuck the words, let's just be friends


you saved me, you made me
and through it all you changed me forever
you love me, you hate me
and through it all you changed me forever


through it all you changed me, i'm not the same me
for better or for worse, this person that you made me
through it all you changed me, i'm not the same me
for better or for worse, you changed me forever
through it all you changed me, i'm not the same me
for better or for worse, this person that you made me
through it all you changed me, i'm not the same me
for better or for worse, you changed me forever"
Prayer Of The Refugee|Rise Against|rock|"
warm yourself by the fire, son
and the morning will come soon
i’ll tell you stories of a better time
in a place that we once knew
before we packed our bags
and left all this behind us in the dust
we had a place that we could call home
and a life no one could touch


don’t hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i don’t need your help now
you will let me down, down, down!
don’t hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i don’t need your help now
you will let me down, down, down!
down!


we are the angry and the desperate
the hungry and the cold
we are the ones who kept quiet
and always did what we were told
but we’ve been sweating
while you slept so calm in the safety of your home
we’ve been pulling out the nails
that hold up everything you’ve known


don’t hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i don’t need your help now
you will let me down, down, down!
don’t hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i don’t need your help now
you will let me down, down, down!


so open your eyes, child
let’s be on our way
broken windows and ashes
are guiding the way
keep quiet no longer
we’ll sing through the day
of the lives that we’ve lost
and the lives we’ve reclaimed
go!


don’t hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i don’t need your help now
you will let me down, down, down!
don’t hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i don’t need your help now
you will let me down, down, down!
down!


don’t hold me up!
(i don’t need your help, i’ll stand my ground)
don’t hold me up!
(i don’t need your help)
no! no! no!
don’t hold me up!
(i don’t need your help, i’ll stand my ground)
don’t hold me up!
(i don’t need your help, i’ll stand my ground)
don’t let me down, down, down, down, down!"

dry ice and something strange

Hurricane|Bob Dylan|rock|"
pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out, “my god, they killed them all!”
here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world


three bodies lying there does patty see
and another man named bello, moving around mysteriously
“i didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“i was only robbing the register, i hope you understand
i saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“one of us had better call up the cops”
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
in the hot new jersey night


meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are driving around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in paterson that’s just the way things go
if you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
unless you want to draw the heat


alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around
he said, “i saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said, “wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men


four in the morning and they haul rubin in
take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
says, “why did you bring him in here for? he is not the guy!”
yes, here’s the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world


four months later, the ghettos are in flame
rubin’s in south america, fighting for his name
while arthur dexter bradley’s still in the robbery game
and the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame
“remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“you think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“think it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?”
“don’t forget that you are white”


arthur dexter bradley said, “i’m really not sure”
cops said, “a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job and we’re talking to your friend bello
now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
you’ll be doing society a favor
that sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder on him
he ain’t no gentleman jim”


rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
""it’s my work,"" he’d say, ""and i do it for pay
and when it’s over i’d just as soon go on my way""
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man into a mouse


all of rubin’s cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
the judge made rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the d.a. said he was the one who did the deed
and the all-white jury agreed


rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
where justice is a game


now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha in a ten-foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell
that’s the story of the hurricane
but it won’t be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he’s done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world"
Black Smoke Rising|Greta Van Fleet|rock|"
did you know there was a tower
where they look out to the land
to see the people quickly passing by
this is for their own desire
as they spit down to the earth
to feel the power boiling in their veins

woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah!


and the black smoke rises
from the fires, we've been told
it's the new age crisis
and we will stand up in the cold

many people are dividing
and a world apart with just one heart
is bound to keel and fade away
none of us will be deciding
and the fate of man is in the hands
of he who stands and heeds the call

The Unforgiven|Metallica|rock|"
new blood joins this earth
and quickly he's subdued
through constant pained disgrace
the young boy learns their rules
with time the child draws in
this whipping boy done wrong
deprived of all his thoughts
the young man struggles on and on he's known
a vow unto his own
that never from this day
his will they'll take away


what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never be, never see
won't see what might have been
what i've felt, what i've known
never shined through in what i've shown
never free, never me
so i dub thee ""unforgiven""


they dedicate their lives
to running all of his
he tries to please them all
this bitter man he is
throughout his life the same
he's battled constantly
this fight he cannot win
a tired man they see no longer cares
the old man then prepares
to die regretfully
that old man here is me

never shined through in what i've shown
never be, never see

i've had enough
there's a voice in my head says i'm better off dead
but if i sing along a little fuckin' louder
to a happy song, i'll be alright


you want to give up
gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
but if you sing along a little fuckin' louder
to a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…


every now and again we get that feelin'
and the great big void inside us opens up
an' i really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
an' i'm goin' 'round in circles, i'm goin' 'round in circles


s-p-i-r-i-t, spirit
let's hear it
s-p-i-r-i-t, spirit
let's hear it


we are possessed
we're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed
but if we sing along a little fuckin' louder
to a happy song, maybe we'll forget, 'cause…


every now and again we get that feelin'
and the great big void inside us opens up
an' i really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
an' i'm goin' 'round in circles, i'm goin' 'round in circles
don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreamin'
'cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
an' i really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
an' i'm goin' 'round in circles, i'm goin' 'round in circles


the world has coalesced
into one giant mess of hate and unrest
so let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
to a happy song and pretend it's all okay (let's go!)


so let's sing along
let's sing along
a little fucking louder!
a little fucking louder!
well, don't you feel so much better?

dropped to my knees when hope ran out
the time has come to change my ways

everything has come to life
a bitter place and a broken dream

i'll never long for what might have been

Youth of the Nation|P.O.D.|rock|"
last day of the rest of my life
i wish, i would've known 'cause i didn't kiss my mama, goodbye!
i didn't tell her that i loved her, how much i cared
or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
unaware, i just did what i always do
every day the same routine before i skate off to school
but who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
instead of takin' a test, i took two to the chest
call me blind, but i didn't see it comin'
everybody was runnin', but i couldn't hear nothin'
except gun blasts, it happened so fast
i don't really know this kid, though i sit by him in class
maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
or maybe for a moment he forgot who he was
or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
whatever it was, i know it's because


we are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
we are, we are (we are) youth of the nation
we are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
we are, we are (we are) youth of the nation


little suzy, she was only twelve
she was given the world with every chance to excel
hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
she might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
she finds love in all the wrong places
the same situations just different faces
changed up her pace since her daddy left her
too bad he never told her, she deserved much better
johnny boy always played the fool
he broke all the rules, so you would think he was cool
he was never really one of the guys
no matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide
it's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
he put his life to an end, they might remember him then
you cross the line and there's no turning back
told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat


we are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
we are, we are (we are) youth of the nation
we are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
we are, we are (we are) youth of the nation


who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim?
no matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
that i feel inside, i'm tired of all the lies
don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind
i guess that's the way the story goes
will it ever make sense? somebody's got to know
there's gotta be more to life than this
there's gotta be more to everything i thought exists

and sometimes i get nervous
when i see an open door
close your eyes, clear your heart
cut the cord


are we human or are we dancer?
my sign is vital, my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees
looking for the answer
are we human or are we dancer?


pay my respects to grace and virtue
send my condolences to good
give my regards to soul and romance
they always did the best they could
and so long to devotion
you taught me everything i know
wave goodbye, wish me well
you've got to let me go


are we human or are we dancer?
my sign is vital, my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees
looking for the answer
are we human or are we dancer?


will your system be alright
when you dream of home tonight?
there is no message we're receiving
let me know, is your heart still beating?

Shape of You|Fame on Fire|rock|"
the club isn't the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking fast and then we talk slow
come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me i'll give it a chance now
take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance, and now i'm singing like

we're going out on our first date
you and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
fill up your bag and i fill up a plate
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
and how your family is doing okay
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
tell the driver make the radio play, and i'm singing like

you create a world i don't want to see
and your forest's a stand of dead trees lost in the night
did you ever think you'd live down the past
you just want to tie yourself to the mast
all your nightmares have come to at last
at least in your mind

breaking on the shore
make your peace with broken streets
your face turned towards the storm

this shitty song needs some personality


your hollow accusations no one ever hears
your wounded senses of pride, a guilty souvenir
all your protests and vacant excuses ring insincere

i just want to light a fire to watch it burn
now we're past the point of no return and no one is here

make your peace with broken streets
your face turned towards the storm


this song needs some fucking personality
anybody? somebody?
give me some fucking personality!
what happened to personality?


you are afraid
uneducated on where this would lead
going on for far too long
we are sorry for the greed
leave us in pieces and places
war-torn and wronged

in between whispers and screams
you permeate my soul
lost between nightmares and dreams
you decimate this home

breaking on the shore
make your peace with broken streets
your face turned towards the storm

how about i disappoint them more?

Stairway to Heaven|Led Zeppelin|rock|"

and she's buying the stairway to heaven

with a word she can get what she came for
ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
there's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven


ooh, makes me wonder
ooh, makes me wonder


there's a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking


ooh, makes me wonder
ooh, really makes me wonder


and it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter


if there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
it's just a spring clean for the may queen
yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
there's still time to change the road you're on


and it makes me wonder
ohhhh, woah


your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
the piper's calling you to join him
dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
your stairway lies on the whispering wind




and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our soul
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all are one and one is all
to be a rock and not to roll


and she's buying the stairway to heaven"

watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away
it's so unreal
you didn't look out below
watch the time go right out the window

keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme
to remind myself how i tried so hard
in spite of the way you were mockin' me
actin' like i was part of your property
remembering all the times you fought with me
i'm surprised it got so far
things aren't the way they were before
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
not that you knew me back then
but it all comes back to me in the end
you kept everything inside
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually

ever since i was a young boy
i've played the silver ball
from soho down to brighton
i must've played 'em all
but i ain't seen nothin' like him
in any amusement hall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball


he stands like a statue
becomes part of the machine
feelin' all the bumpers
always playin' clean
plays by intuition
the digit counters fall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball


he's a pinball wizard
there has to be a twist
a pinball wizard's
got such a supple wrist


how do you think he does it?
i don't know!
what makes him so good?


ain't got no distractions
can't hear no buzzes and bells
don't see no lights a-flashin'
plays by sense of smell
always gets the replay
never seen him fall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball


i thought i was
the bally table king
but i just handed
my pinball crown to him


even on my favorite table
he can beat my best
disciples lead him in
and he just does the rest
he's got crazy flipper fingers
never seen him fall
that deaf, dumb, and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball"
Paint It Black|The Rolling Stones|rock|"
i see a red door and i want it painted black
no colours anymore, i want them to turn black
i see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
i have to turn my head until my darkness goes


i see a line of cars and they're all painted black
with flowers and my love, both never to come back
i see people turn their heads and quickly look away
like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
i look inside myself and see my heart is black
i see my red door, i must have it painted black
maybe then i'll fade away and not have to face the facts
it's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
no more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
i could not foresee this thing happening to you
if i look hard enough into the setting sun
my love will laugh with me before the morning comes


i see a red door and i want it painted black
no colours anymore, i want them to turn black
i see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes

i wanna see it painted, painted black
black as night, black as coal
i wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky

butane in my veins and i'm out to cut the junkie
with the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
kill the headlights and put it in neutral
stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
baby's in reno with the vitamin d

someone came in saying i’m insane to complain
about a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

so shave your face with some mace in the dark
saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park

one’s on the pole, shove the other in a bag
with the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
the daytime crap of the folksinger slob
he hung himself with a guitar string
a slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

begin the day with a friendly voice
a companion unobtrusive
plays that song that's so elusive
and the magic music makes your morning mood


off on your way, hit the open road
there is magic at your fingers
for the spirit ever lingers
undemanding contact in your happy solitude


invisible airwaves crackle with life
bright antenna bristle with the energy
emotional feedback on timeless wavelength
bearing a gift beyond price, almost free


all this machinery making modern music
can still be open-hearted
not so coldly charted
it's really just a question of your honesty
yeah, your honesty
one likes to believe in the freedom of music
but glittering prizes
and endless compromises
shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah


invisible airwaves crackle with life
bright antenna bristle with the energy
emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
bearing a gift beyond price, almost free




for the words of the prophets

she said lay me down in golden dandelions
'cause i've been waiting


a thousand pictures in my mind
in a painting of the past
i'm brushing over lines
and i'll paint them all again
we're floating fast over traffic lights
bearing down on blackened skies
colors burst as i close my eyes


ooo-oooh, she said
lay me down in golden dandelions
'cause i've been waiting for this moment all my life
follow me into the dark
ooo-oooh
she said lay me down in golden dandelions
'cause i've been waiting


and aren't we bright
in the candlelight?
i will cradle all these memories
until the end


and she said
lay me down in golden dandelions
'cause i've been waiting for this moment all my life
follow me into the dark
ooo-oooh

Voodoo|Godsmack|rock|"
i'm not the one who's so far away
when i feel the snake bite enter my veins
never did i wanna be here again
and i don't remember why i came


candles raise my desire
why i'm so far away
no more meaning to my life
no more reason to stay
freezing feeling
breathe in, breathe in
i'm coming back again




hazing clouds rain on my head
empty thoughts fill my ears
find my shade by the moon light
why my thoughts aren't so clear
demons dreaming
breathe in, breathe in
i'm coming back again

voodoo, voodoo, voodoo, voodoo



so far away...
i'm not the one who's so far away...
i'm not the one who's so far away...

you say true love is suicide
you say you've cried a thousand rivers

you left me drownin' in my tears
and you won't save me anymore

one promise that always remains
no matter the price
a promise to survive
persevere and thrive

and you said: ""the poison in a kiss is the lie upon the lips""
truer words were never shared
when i feel like lies are all i hear
i pull my memories near, the one thing they can't take

one promise that always remains
no matter the price

persevere and thrive

the books still open on the table
the bells still ringing in the air
the dreams still clinging to the pillow
the songs still singing in a prayer


now my soul is stretching through the roots
to memories of you
back through time and space
to carry home
the faces and the names
and photographs of you, rescued from the flames


one promise you made
one promise that always remains
no matter the price
a promise to survive
persevere and thrive
and dare to rise once more

Bring Me To Life|Evanescence|rock|"
how can you see into my eyes like open doors?
leading you down into my core
where i've become so numb, without a soul
my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
until you find it there and lead it back home


wake me up, wake me up inside
i can't wake up ,wake me up inside
save me, call my name and save me from the dark
wake me up, bid my blood to run
i can't wake up, before i come undone
save me, save me from the nothing i've become


now that i know what i'm without
you can't just leave me
breathe into me and make me real
bring me to life


wake me up, wake me up inside
i can't wake up, wake me up inside
save me, call my name and save me from the dark
wake me up, bid my blood to run
i can't wake up, before i come undone
save me, save me from the nothing i've become


bring me to life
i've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
bring me to life
frozen inside, without your touch
without your love, darling
only you are the life
among the dead


all this time, i can't believe i couldn't see
kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
i've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
got to open my eyes to everything!
without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
don't let me die here
there must be something more!
bring me to life!


wake me up, wake me up inside
i can't wake up, wake me up inside
save me, call my name and save me from the dark
wake me up, bid my blood to run
i can't wake up, before i come undone
save me, save me from the nothing i've become


bring me to life
i've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
bring me to life"
Like a Rolling Stone|Bob Dylan|rock|"
once upon a time you dressed so fine
threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
people call, say ""beware doll, you're bound to fall""
you thought they were all a-kiddin' you
you used to laugh about
everybody that was hangin' out
now you don't talk so loud
now you don't seem so proud
about having to be scrounging your next meal


how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be without a home?
like a complete unknown?
like a rolling stone?


aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, miss lonely
but ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
and now you’re gonna have to get used to it
you say you never compromise
with the mystery tramp, but now you realize
he's not selling any alibis
as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
and say, “do you want to make a deal?""


how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?


aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
on the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
never understood that it ain't no good
you shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
you used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
ain't it hard when you discover that
he really wasn't where it's at
after he took from you everything he could steal?


how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to hang out on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?


aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
exchangin' all precious gifts
but you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
you used to be so amused
at napoleon in rags and the language that he used
go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
when ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
you're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal


how does it feel?
aw, how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown

The Vengeful One|Disturbed|rock|"


he is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
it's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
hear the innocent voices scream
as their tormentors laugh through all of it
no forgiveness from all i've seen
the degradation i cannot forget


so sleep soundly in your beds tonight
for judgement falls upon you at first light


i'm the hand of god
i'm the dark messiah
i'm the vengeful one
(look inside and see what you're becoming)
in the blackest moment of a dying world
what have you become
(look inside and see what you're becoming)


as the violence surges
and the teeming masses have been terrorized
the human predators all gone mad
are reaping profits born from their demise
the rabid media plays their roles
stoking the flames of war to no surprise
only too eager to sell their souls
for the apocalypse must be televised


so sleep soundly in your beds tonight
for judgement falls upon you at first light


i'm the hand of god
i'm the dark messiah
i'm the vengeful one
(look inside and see what you're becoming)
in the blackest moment of a dying world
what have you become
(look inside and see what you're becoming)


when you die
you'll know why
for you cannot be saved
with all the world enslaved
when you die
you'll know why

you'll die

for you cannot be saved
this world is too depraved
when you die
you'll know why

you will discover a war you're unable to win


i'll have you know that i've become


indestructible
determination that is incorruptible
from the other side a terror to behold
annihilation will be unavoidable
every broken enemy will know
that their opponent tend to be invincible
take a last look around while you're alive
i'm an indestructible master of war


another reason, another cause for me to fight
another fuse uncovered now, for me to light
my dedication to all that i've sworn to protect
i carry out my orders without a regret
a declaration embedded deep under my skin
a permanent reminder of how it began
no hesitation when i am commanded to strike
you need to know that you're in for the fight of your life


you will be shown how i've become


indestructible
determination that is incorruptible
from the other side a terror to behold
annihilation will be unavoidable
every broken enemy will know
that their opponent tend to be invincible
take a last look around while you're alive
i'm an indestructible master of war


i'm indestructible

Civil War|Guns N' Roses|rock|"
what we've got here is failure to communicate
some men, you just can't reach
so, you get what we had here, last week
which is the way he wants it
well, he gets it
*whistling*
and i don't like it any more than you men


look at your young men fighting
look at your women crying
look at your young men dying
the way they've always done before
look at the hate we're breeding
look at the fear we're feeding
look at the lives we're leading
the way we've always done before


my hands are tied
the billions shift from side to side
an' the wars go on with brainwashed pride
for the love of god and our human rights
an' all these things are swept aside
by bloody hands, time can't deny
an' are washed away by your genocide
an' history hides the lies of our civil wars




d'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
who said peace could last forever?
an' in my first memories, they shot kennedy
i went numb when i learned to see
so i never fell for vietnam
we got the wall in d.c. to remind us all
that you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
when everybody's fightin' for their promised land


and i don't need your civil war
it feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
ain't that fresh? i don't need your civil war
ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no


look at the shoes you're filling
look at the blood we're spilling
look at the world we're killing
the way we've always done before
look in the doubt we've wallowed
look at the leaders we've followed
look at the lies we've swallowed
an' i don't want to hear no more


my hands are tied
for all, i've seen has changed my mind
but still, the wars go on, as the years go by
with no love of god or human rights
an' all these dreams are swept aside
by bloody hands of the hypnotized
who carry the cross of homicide
and history bears the scars of our civil wars




we practice selective annihilation
of mayors and government officials
for example, to create a vacuum
then we fill that vacuum
as popular war advances
peace is closer


i don't need your civil war
it feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
ain't that fresh? i don't need your civil war
no no no no no no no no no no no no
i don't need your civil war
i don't need your civil war

but i just won't do...


but i'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
no way

and i would do anything for love
oh i would do anything for love
oh i would do anything for love
but i won't do that
no i won't do that


will you raise me up?
will you help me down?
will you help get me right out of this godforsaken town?
will you make it all a little less cold?


i can do that!
i can do that!


will you hold me sacred
will you hold me tight
will you colorize my life
i'm so sick of black and white!
can you make it all a little less old


i can do that!
oh, oh, i can do that!


will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
can you give me something i can take home?


i can do that
i can do that


will you cater to every fantasy i've got?
will you hose me down with holy water - if i get too hot?
will you take me to places i'll never know?


i can do that!
oh no, no, i can do that!


after a while you'll forget everything
just a brief interlude, and a mid-summer night's fling
then you'll see that it's time to move on


i won't do that
i won't do that


i know the territory - i've been around
it'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
sooner or later you'll be screwing around


i won't do that!
no, i won't do that!


anything for love
oh i would do anything for love!
i would do anything for love!

no, i won't do that"

but it's made of all the things i have to take
jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside

i have screamed until my veins collapsed
i've waited as my time's elapsed
now all i do is live with so much fate
i've wished for this, i've bitched at that
i've left behind this little fact
you cannot kill what you did not create
i've gotta say what i've gotta say
and then i swear i'll go away
but i can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
i guess i'll save the best for last
my future seems like one big past
you're left with me 'cause you left me no choice


i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
if the pain goes on, i'm not gonna make it


put me back together or separate the skin from bone
leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
tell me the reality is better than the dream
but i found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems

it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache

i been searching for an answer
always just out of reach
blood on the floor
sirens repeat
i been searching for the courage
to face my enemies
when they turn down the lights


i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake


for my battle symphony
for my battle symphony


they say that i don’t belong
say that i should retreat
that i’m marching to the rhythm
of a lonesome defeat
but the sound of your voice
puts the pain in reverse
no surrender, no illusions
and for better or worse
when they turn down the lights


i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together

please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake


if i fall, get knocked down
pick myself up off the ground

Beautiful Day|U2|rock|"
the heart is a bloom
shoots up through the stoney ground
there's no room
no space to rent in this town
you're out of luck
and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck
and you're not moving anywhere
you thought you'd found a friend
to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand
in return for grace


it's a beautiful day
sky falls, you feel like
it's a beautiful day
don't let it get away


you're on the road
but you've got no destination
you're in the mud
in the maze of her imagination
you love this town
even if that doesn't ring true
you've been all over
and it's been all over you


it's a beautiful day
don't let it get away
it's a beautiful day
ooh-hoo-hoo


touch me
take me to that other place
teach me
i know i'm not a hopeless case


see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light
and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colours came out


it's a beautiful day
don't let it get away
beautiful day


touch me
take me to that other place
reach me

I Remember You|Skid Row|rock|"
woke up to the sound of pouring rain
the wind would whisper and i'd think of you
and all the tears you cried, that called my name
and when you needed me i came through


i paint a picture of the days gone by
when love went blind and you would make me see
i'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
so that i knew you were there for me
time after time you were there for me


remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
love letters in the sands - i remember you
through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
i'd wanna hear you say - i remember you
oh, whoa


we spent the summer with the top rolled down
and wished ever after would be like this
you said ""i love you babe,"" without a sound
i said i'd give my life for just one kiss
i'd live for your smile and die for your kiss


remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
love letters in the sands - i remember you
and through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
i'd wanna hear you say - i remember you, oh


we've had our share of hard times, but that's the price we paid
and through it all we kept the promise that we made
i swear you'll never be lonely


we woke up to the sound of pouring rain
washed away a dream of you
but nothing else could ever take you away
'cause you'll always be my dream come true

of how we calmed the tides of war

i am iron man!


has he lost his mind?
can he see or is he blind?
can he walk at all
or if he moves will he fall?


is he alive or dead?
has he thoughts within his head?
we'll just pass him there
why should we even care?


he was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
when he traveled time
for the future of mankind


nobody wants him
he just stares at the world
planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfurl


now, the time is here
for iron man to spread fear
vengeance from the grave
kills the people he once saved


nobody wants him
they just turn their heads
nobody helps him
now, he has his revenge




heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
running as fast as they can
iron man lives again!

If Today Was Your Last Day|Nickelback|rock|"
my best friend gave me the best advice
he said each day's a gift and not a given right
leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
and try to take the path less traveled by
that first step you take is the longest stride
(what if, what if?)


if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday? (what if, what if?)
would you live each moment like your last?
leave old pictures in the past?
donate every dime you have?
(what if, what if?)
if today was your last day
(what if, what if?)
(if today was your last day)


against the grain should be a way of life
what's worth the prize is always worth the fight
every second counts 'cause there's no second try
so live like you'll never live it twice
don't take the free ride in your own life
(what if, what if?)


if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday? (what if, what if?)
would you live each moment like your last?
leave old pictures in the past?
donate every dime you have? (what if, what if?)
and would you call old friends you never see?
reminisce old memories?
would you forgive your enemies? (what if, what if?)
would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
swear up and down to god above
that you finally fall in love? (that you finally fall in love)
if today was your last day


if today was your last day
would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
you know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
regardless of who you are
so do whatever it takes (takes)
'cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
let nothin' stand in your way (way)
'cause the hands of time are never on your side


if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday?
would you live each moment like your last?
leave old pictures in the past?
donate every dime you have? (what if, what if?)
and would you call old friends you never see?
reminisce old memories?
would you forgive your enemies? (what if, what if?)
would you find that one you're dreamin' of?

keep climbin' the mountain
even when i feel like dyin'

another night i'm barely holdin' on
one step away from being dead and gone

is this life that i've been livin' all that's meant for me?


every day i'm just survivin'
keep climbin' the mountain
even when i feel like dyin'
keep climbin' the mountain
every time i think i'm over it
i wake up in the bottom of it all again
i'm still survivin', keep climbin'
keep climbin' the mountain


the higher i go, the harder i fall
so i don't look down, i don't look back at all
and when i wish it all would turn to black
i try to see the light and push the darkness back

Maggie May|Rod Stewart|rock|"ake up, maggie
i think i got something to say to you
it's late september and
i really should be back at school
i know i keep you amused
but i feel i'm being used
oh, maggie, i couldn't have tried anymore
you led me away from home
just to save you from being alone
you stole my heart and that's what really hurts

the morning sun, when it's in your face
really shows your age
that don't worry me none
in my eyes you're everything
i laughed at all of your jokes
my love you didn't need to coax
oh, maggie, i couldn't have tried anymore
you led me away from home
just to save you from being alone
you stole my soul and that's a pain i can do without

all i needed was a friend
to lend a guiding hand
but you turned into a lover
and mother what a lover!
you wore me out
all you did was wreck my bed
and in the morning kick me in the head
oh, maggie, i couldn't have tried anymore
you led me away from home
cause you didn't want to be alone
you stole my heart
i couldn't leave you if i tried

i suppose i could collect my books
and get on back to school
or steal my daddy's cue
and make a living out of playing pool
or find myself a rock & roll band
that needs a helping hand
oh, maggie, i wish i'd never seen your face
you made a first-class fool out of me
but i'm as blind as a fool can be
you stole my heart but i love you anyway

maggie, i wished i'd never seen your face
i'll get on back home one of these days"

Upside Down|Jack Johnson|rock|"

i can feel a change in everything

and as the surface breaks, reflections fade
but in some ways, they remain the same
and as my mind begins to spread its wings
there's no stopping curiosity


i want to turn the whole thing upside down
i'll find the things they say just can't be found
i'll share this love i find with everyone
we'll sing and dance to mother nature's songs
i don't want this feeling to go away


who's to say, i can't do everything
well i can try
and as i roll along i begin to find
things aren't always just what they seem

i'll find the things they say just can't be found
i'll share this love i find with everyone
we'll sing and dance to mother nature's songs
this world keeps spinning
and there is no time to waste
will it all keep spinning spinning round and round and


upside down

War Pigs / Luke's Wall|Black Sabbath|rock|"he drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, staring into the dark pool of the jar. the yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turf-coloured water of the bath in clongowes. the box of pawn tickets at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as daly or macevoy.

1 pair buskins
1 d. coat
3 articles and white
1 man's pants

then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of the box, speckled with louse marks, and asked vaguely:

—how much is the clock fast now?

his mother straightened the battered alarm clock that was lying on its side in the middle of the mantelpiece until its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more on its side.

—an hour and twenty-five minutes, she said. the right time now is twenty past ten. the dear knows you might try to be in time for your lectures.

—fill out the place for me to wash, said stephen.

—katey, fill out the place for stephen to wash.

—boody, fill out the place for stephen to wash.

—i can't, i'm going for blue. fill it out, you, maggy.

when the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and the old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose.

—well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student is so dirty that his mother has to wash him.

—but it gives you pleasure, said stephen calmly.

an ear-splitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his mother thrust a damp overall into his hands, saying:

—dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness.

a second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of the girls to the foot of the staircase.

—yes, father?

—is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet?

—yes, father.

—sure?

—yes, father.

—hm!

the girl came back, making signs to him to be quick and go out quietly by the back. stephen laughed and said:

—he has a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is masculine.

—ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, stephen, said his mother, and you'll live to rue the day you set your foot in that place. i know how it has changed you.

—good morning, everybody, said stephen, smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu.

the lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse beyond the wall.

—jesus! o jesus! jesus!

he shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. his father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth. he drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries.

the rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of gerhart hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. his morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of newman; that as he walked along the north strand road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour of guido cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by baird's stonecutting works in talbot place the spirit of ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the liffey he would repeat the song by ben jonson which begins:

i was not wearier where i lay

his mind when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral words of aristotle or aquinas turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the elizabethans. his mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist-coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and drove him on from his lurking-place

the lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that it had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of slender sentences from aristotle's poetics and psychology and a synopsis philosophiae scholasticae ad mentem divi thomae. his thinking was a dusk of doubt and self-mistrust, lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at least he had been acquainted with nobility. but when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart

near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly buttoned into his chocolate overcoat, and holding his furled umbrella a span or two from him like a divining rod. it must be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. the clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him, but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift precision. he laughed as he heard it for it made him think of mccann, and he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair goatee, standing in the wind at hopkins' corner, and heard him say:

—dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself. i'm not. i'm a democrat and i'll work and act for social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the united states of the europe of the future

eleven! then he was late for that lecture too. what day of the week was it? he stopped at a newsagent's to read the headline of a placard. thursday. ten to eleven, english; eleven to twelve, french; twelve to one, physics. he fancied to himself the english lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and helpless. he saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side. his own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. another head than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him. why was it that when he thought of cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face? even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. it was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor, in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly smiling; and stephen, remembering swiftly how he had told cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and night by night, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes

through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling that it was not yet the hour to enter it. but the nightshade of his friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and he found himself glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. his own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:

the ivy whines upon the wall
and whines and twines upon the wall
the yellow ivy upon the wall
ivy, ivy up the wall

did anyone ever hear such drivel? lord almighty! who ever heard of ivy whining on a wall? yellow ivy; that was all right. yellow ivory also. and what about ivory ivy?

the word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. ivory, ivoire, avorio, ebur. one of the first examples that he had learnt in latin had run: india mittit ebur; and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to construe the metamorphoses of ovid in a courtly english, made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon. he had learnt what little he knew of the laws of latin verse from a ragged book written by a portuguese priest

contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates

the crises and victories and secessions in roman history were handed on to him in the trite words in tanto discrimine and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through the words implere ollam denariorum which the rector had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries. the pages of his time-worn horace never felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold; they were human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers of john duncan inverarity and by his brother, william malcolm inverarity. yes, those were noble names on the dusky flyleaf and, even for so poor a latinist as he, the dusky verses were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and vervain; but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry

the grey block of trinity on his left, set heavily in the city's ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled his mind downward and while he was striving this way and that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of ireland

he looked at it without anger; for, though sloth of the body and of the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. it was a firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a milesian; and he thought of his friend davin, the peasant student. it was a jesting name between them, but the young peasant bore with it lightly:

—go on, stevie, i have a hard head, you tell me. call me what you will

the homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. often, as he sat in davin's rooms in grantham street, wondering at his friend's well-made boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection, the rude firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old english speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill—for davin had sat at the feet of michael cusack, the gael—repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of soul of a starving irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear

side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle mat davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of ireland. the gossip of his fellow-students which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. his nurse had taught him irish and shaped his rude imagination by the broken lights of irish myth. he stood towards the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided against themselves as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dull-witted loyal serf. whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from england or by way of english culture his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password; and of the world that lay beyond england he knew only the foreign legion of france in which he spoke of serving

coupling this ambition with the young man's humour stephen had often called him one of the tame geese and there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed so often to stand between stephen's mind, eager of speculation, and the hidden ways of irish life

one night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious language in which stephen escaped from the cold silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before stephen's mind a strange vision. the two were walking slowly towards davin's rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer jews

—a thing happened to myself, stevie, last autumn, coming on winter, and i never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now i ever told it to. i disremember if it was october or november. it was october because it was before i came up here to join the matriculation class

stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speaker's simple accent

—i was away all that day from my own place over in buttevant

—i don't know if you know where that is—at a hurling match between the croke's own boys and the fearless thurles and by god, stevie, that was the hard fight. my first cousin, fonsy davin, was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for the limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time and shouting like mad. i never will forget that day. one of the crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with his caman and i declare to god he was within an aim's ace of getting it at the side of his temple. oh, honest to god, if the crook of it caught him that time he was done for

—i am glad he escaped, stephen had said with a laugh, but surely that's not the strange thing that happened you?

—well, i suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match that i missed the train home and i couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. so there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. well, i started to walk and on i went and it was coming on night when i got into the ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. you wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. it was pitch dark almost. once or twice i stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick i'd have stretched out there and slept. at last, after a bend of the road, i spied a little cottage with a light in the window. i went up and knocked at the door. a voice asked who was there and i answered i was over at the match in buttevant and was walking back and that i'd be thankful for a glass of water. after a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. she was half undressed as if she was going to bed when i knocked and she had her hair hanging and i thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. she kept me in talk a long while at the door, and i thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. she asked me was i tired and would i like to stop the night there. she said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to queenstown with his sister to see her off. and all the time she was talking, stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me i could hear her breathing. when i handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said: 'come in and stay the night here. you've no call to be frightened. there's no one in it but ourselves...' i didn't go in, stevie. i thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. at the first bend of the road i looked back and she was standing at the door

the last words of davin's story sang in his memory and the figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at clane as the college cars drove by, as a type of her race and of his own, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile, calling the stranger to her bed

a hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried:

—ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! the first handsel today, gentleman. buy that lovely bunch. will you, gentleman?

the blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness, and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face

—do, gentleman! don't forget your own girl, sir!

—i have no money, said stephen

—buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? only a penny

—did you hear what i said? asked stephen, bending towards her. i told you i had no money. i tell you again now

—well, sure, you will some day, sir, please god, the girl answered after an instant

—possibly, said stephen, but i don't think it likely

he left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from england or a student of trinity. grafton street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. in the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of wolfe tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. he remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. there were four french delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: vive l'irlande!

but the trees in stephen's green were fragrant of rain and the rain-sodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. the soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other than that of buck egan and burnchapel whaley

it was too late to go upstairs to the french class. he crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre. the corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful. why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? was it because he had heard that in buck whaley's time there was a secret staircase there? or was the jesuit house extra-territorial and was he walking among aliens? the ireland of tone and of parnell seemed to have receded in space

he opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. a figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire. stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace

—good morning, sir! can i help you?

the priest looked up quickly and said:

—one moment now, mr dedalus, and you will see. there is an art in lighting a fire. we have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts. this is one of the useful arts

—i will try to learn it, said stephen

—not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his task, that is one of the secrets

he produced four candle-butts from the side-pockets of his soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers. stephen watched him in silence. kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the lord. like a levite's robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and trouble. his very body had waxed old in lowly service of the lord—in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden—and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. nay, his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity—a mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down

the dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch. stephen, to fill the silence, said:

—i am sure i could not light a fire

—you are an artist, are you not, mr dedalus? said the dean, glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. the object of the artist is the creation of the beautiful. what the beautiful is is another question

he rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty

—can you solve that question now? he asked

—aquinas, answered stephen, says pulcra sunt quae visa placent

—this fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye. will it therefore be beautiful?

—in so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which i suppose means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. but aquinas also says bonum est in quod tendit appetitus. in so far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. in hell, however, it is an evil

—quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the head

he rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and said:

—a draught is said to be a help in these matters

as he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a brisk step, stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale loveless eyes. like ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no spark of ignatius's enthusiasm. even the legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his soul with the energy of apostleship. it seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for the greater glory of god, without joy in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and little, if at all, the ends he served. similiter atque senis baculus, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a staff in an old man's hand, to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather, to lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace

the dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin

—when may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic question? he asked

—from me! said stephen in astonishment. i stumble on an idea once a fortnight if i am lucky

—these questions are very profound, mr dedalus, said the dean. it is like looking down from the cliffs of moher into the depths. many go down into the depths and never come up. only the trained diver can go down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again

—if you mean speculation, sir, said stephen, i also am sure that there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must be bound by its own laws

—ha!

—for my purpose i can work on at present by the light of one or two ideas of aristotle and aquinas

—i see. i quite see your point

—i need them only for my own use and guidance until i have done something for myself by their light. if the lamp smokes or smells i shall try to trim it. if it does not give light enough i shall sell it and buy another

—epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for a fancy price after his death. it was the lamp he wrote his philosophical dissertations by. you know epictetus?

—an old gentleman, said stephen coarsely, who said that the soul is very like a bucketful of water

—he tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief stole the lamp. what did the philosopher do? he reflected that it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp

a smell of molten tallow came up from the dean's candle butts and fused itself in stephen's consciousness with the jingle of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. the priest's voice, too, had a hard jingling tone. stephen's mind halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the imagery and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a reflector hung in a false focus. what lay behind it or within it? a dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of god?

—i meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said stephen

—undoubtedly, said the dean

—one difficulty, said stephen, in esthetic discussion is to know whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. i remember a sentence of newman's in which he says of the blessed virgin that she was detained in the full company of the saints. the use of the word in the marketplace is quite different. i hope i am not detaining you

—not in the least, said the dean politely

—no, no, said stephen, smiling, i mean—

—yes, yes; i see, said the dean quickly, i quite catch the point: detain

he thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough

—to return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice problem. you must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more than the funnel can hold

—what funnel? asked stephen

—the funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp

—that? said stephen. is that called a funnel? is it not a tundish?

—what is a tundish?

—that. the... funnel

—is that called a tundish in ireland? asked the dean. i never heard the word in my life

—it is called a tundish in lower drumcondra, said stephen, laughing, where they speak the best english

—a tundish, said the dean reflectively. that is a most interesting word. i must look that word up. upon my word i must

his courtesy of manner rang a little false and stephen looked at the english convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal. a humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions, a poor englishman in ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through—a late-comer, a tardy spirit. from what had he set out? perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, seeing salvation in jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of the establishment. had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? had he found the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of cotton some fine-spun line of reasoning upon insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the holy ghost? or had lord christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the door of some zinc-roofed chapel, yawning and telling over his church pence?

the dean repeated the word yet again

—tundish! well now, that is interesting!

—the question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting. what is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of earth, said stephen coldly

the little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. he felt with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was a countryman of ben jonson. he thought:

—the language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. how different are the words home, christ, ale, master, on his lips and on mine! i cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. his language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. i have not made or accepted its words. my voice holds them at bay. my soul frets in the shadow of his language

—and to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, the dean added, to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty. and to inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts. these are some interesting points we might take up

stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm, dry tone, was silent; and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the staircase

—in pursuing these speculations, said the dean conclusively, there is, however, the danger of perishing of inanition. first you must take your degree. set that before you as your first aim. then, little by little, you will see your way. i mean in every sense, your way in life and in thinking. it may be uphill pedalling at first. take mr moonan. he was a long time before he got to the top. but he got there

—i may not have his talent, said stephen quietly

—you never know, said the dean brightly. we never can say what is in us. i most certainly should not be despondent. per aspera ad astra

he left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first arts' class

leaning against the fireplace stephen heard him greet briskly and impartially every student of the class and could almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students. a desolating pity began to fall like dew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful serving-man of the knightly loyola, for this half-brother of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never call his ghostly father; and he thought how this man and his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of god's justice for the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent

the entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows. the calling of the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all tones until the name of peter byrne was reached

—here!

a deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, followed by coughs of protest along the other benches

the professor paused in his reading and called the next name:

—cranly!

no answer

—mr cranly!

a smile flew across stephen's face as he thought of his friend's studies

—try leopardstown! said a voice from the bench behind

stephen glanced up quickly but moynihan's snoutish face, outlined on the grey light, was impassive. a formula was given out. amid the rustling of the notebooks stephen turned back again and said:

—give me some paper for god's sake

—are you as bad as that? asked moynihan with a broad grin

he tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whispering:

—in case of necessity any layman or woman can do it

the formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, the spectre-like symbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded stephen's mind. he had heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason. o the grey dull day! it seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever vaster, farther and more impalpable

—so we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of mr w. s. gilbert. in one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to play:

on a cloth untrue
with a twisted cue
and elliptical billiard balls

—he means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal axes of which i spoke a moment ago

moynihan leaned down towards stephen's ear and murmured:

—what price ellipsoidal balls! chase me, ladies, i'm in the cavalry!

his fellow student's rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister of stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule. the forms of the community emerged from the gust-blown vestments, the dean of studies, the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall form of the young professor of mental science discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled prefect of the sodality, the plump round-headed professor of italian with his rogue's eyes. they came ambling and stumbling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog, holding one another back, shaken with deep false laughter, smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude malice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering two and two behind their hands

the professor had gone to the glass cases on the side wall, from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the table, held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. he explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound called platinoid lately discovered by f. w. martino

he spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. moynihan whispered from behind:

—good old fresh water martin!

—ask him, stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he wants a subject for electrocution. he can have me

moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin

—please teacher! this boy is after saying a bad word, teacher

—platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to german silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance by changes of temperature. the platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. if it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the coils. the bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax...

a sharp ulster voice said from the bench below stephen:

—are we likely to be asked questions on applied science?

the professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and applied science. a heavy-built student, wearing gold spectacles, stared with some wonder at the questioner. moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice:

—isn't macalister a devil for his pound of flesh?

stephen looked coldly on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown with tangled twine-coloured hair. the voice, the accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his mind think that the student's father would have done better had he sent his son to belfast to study and have saved something on the train fare by so doing

the oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring; for he saw in a moment the student's whey-pale face

—that thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. it came from the comic irishman in the bench behind. patience. can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was bartered and its elect betrayed—by the questioner or by the mocker? patience. remember epictetus. it is probably in his character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a tone and to pronounce the word science as a monosyllable

the droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance

moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell:

—closing time, gents!

the entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. on a table near the door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of signatures. maccann went briskly to and fro among the students, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after another to the table. in the inner hall the dean of studies stood talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nodding his head

stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. from under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat cranly's dark eyes were watching him

—have you signed? stephen asked

cranly closed his long thin-lipped mouth, communed with himself an instant and answered:

—ego habeo

—what is it for?

—quod?

—what is it for?

cranly turned his pale face to stephen and said blandly and bitterly:

—per pax universalis

stephen pointed to the tsar's photograph and said:

—he has the face of a besotted christ

the scorn and anger in his voice brought cranly's eyes back from a calm survey of the walls of the hall

—are you annoyed? he asked

—no, answered stephen

—are you in bad humour?

—no

—credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis, said cranly, quia facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis

moynihan, on his way to the table, said in stephen's ear:

—maccann is in tiptop form. ready to shed the last drop. brand new world. no stimulants and votes for the bitches

stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when moynihan had passed, turned again to meet cranly's eyes

—perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul so freely into my ear. can you?

a dull scowl appeared on cranly's forehead. he stared at the table where moynihan had bent to write his name on the roll, and then said flatly:

—a sugar!

—quis est in malo humore, said stephen, ego aut vos?

cranly did not take up the taunt. he brooded sourly on his judgement and repeated with the same flat force:

—a flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is!

it was his epitaph for all dead friendships and stephen wondered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory. the heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of hearing like a stone through a quagmire. stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another, feeling its heaviness depress his heart. cranly's speech, unlike that of davin, had neither rare phrases of elizabethan english nor quaintly turned versions of irish idioms. its drawl was an echo of the quays of dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of the sacred eloquence of dublin given back flatly by a wicklow pulpit

the heavy scowl faded from cranly's face as maccann marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall

—here you are! said maccann cheerily

—here i am! said stephen

—late as usual. can you not combine the progressive tendency with a respect for punctuality?

—that question is out of order, said stephen. next business

his smiling eyes were fixed on a silver-wrapped tablet of milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breast-pocket. a little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. a lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist mouth. cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it over and over

—next business? said maccann. hom!

he gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and tugged twice at the straw-coloured goatee which hung from his blunt chin

—the next business is to sign the testimonial

—will you pay me anything if i sign? asked stephen

—i thought you were an idealist, said maccann

the gipsy-like student looked about him and addressed the onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice

—by hell, that's a queer notion. i consider that notion to be a mercenary notion

his voice faded into silence. no heed was paid to his words. he turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards stephen, inviting him to speak again

maccann began to speak with fluent energy of the tsar's rescript, of stead, of general disarmament arbitration in cases of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number

the gipsy student responded to the close of the period by crying:

—three cheers for universal brotherhood!

—go on, temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. i'll stand you a pint after

—i'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said temple, glancing about him out of his dark oval eyes. marx is only a bloody cod

cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling uneasily, and repeated:

—easy, easy, easy!

temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth flecked by a thin foam:

—socialism was founded by an irishman and the first man in europe who preached the freedom of thought was collins. two hundred years ago. he denounced priestcraft, the philosopher of middlesex. three cheers for john anthony collins!

a thin voice from the verge of the ring replied:

—pip! pip!

moynihan murmured beside stephen's ear:

—and what about john anthony's poor little sister:

lottie collins lost her drawers;
won't you kindly lend her yours?

stephen laughed and moynihan, pleased with the result, murmured again:

—we'll have five bob each way on john anthony collins

—i am waiting for your answer, said maccann briefly

—the affair doesn't interest me in the least, said stephen wearily. you know that well. why do you make a scene about it?

—good! said maccann, smacking his lips. you are a reactionary, then?

—do you think you impress me, stephen asked, when you flourish your wooden sword?

—metaphors! said maccann bluntly. come to facts

stephen blushed and turned aside. maccann stood his ground and said with hostile humour:

—minor poets, i suppose, are above such trivial questions as the question of universal peace

cranly raised his head and held the handball between the two students by way of a peace-offering, saying:

—pax super totum sanguinarium globum

stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder angrily in the direction of the tsar's image, saying:

—keep your icon. if we must have a jesus let us have a legitimate jesus

—by hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those about him, that's a fine expression. i like that expression immensely

he gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed cap, turned to stephen, saying:

—excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you uttered just now?

feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to them:

—i am curious to know now what he meant by that expression

he turned again to stephen and said in a whisper:

—do you believe in jesus? i believe in man. of course, i don't know if you believe in man. i admire you, sir. i admire the mind of man independent of all religions. is that your opinion about the mind of jesus?

—go on, temple, said the stout ruddy student, returning, as was his won't, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you

—he thinks i'm an imbecile, temple explained to stephen, because i'm a believer in the power of mind

cranly linked his arms into those of stephen and his admirer and said:

—nos ad manum ballum jocabimus

stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of maccann's flushed blunt-featured face

—my signature is of no account, he said politely. you are right to go your way. leave me to go mine

—dedalus, said maccann crisply, i believe you're a good fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of the human individual

a voice said:

—intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in it

stephen, recognizing the harsh tone of macalister's voice did not turn in the direction of the voice. cranly pushed solemnly through the throng of students, linking stephen and temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to the altar

temple bent eagerly across cranly's breast and said:

—did you hear macalister what he said? that youth is jealous of you. did you see that? i bet cranly didn't see that. by hell, i saw that at once

as they crossed the inner hall, the dean of studies was in the act of escaping from the student with whom he had been conversing. he stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the lowest step, his threadbare soutane gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating:

—not a doubt of it, mr hackett! very fine! not a doubt of it!

in the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a boarder. as he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil

—i hope the matric men will all come. the first arts' men are pretty sure. second arts, too. we must make sure of the newcomers

temple bent again across cranly, as they were passing through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper:

—do you know that he is a married man? he was a married man before they converted him. he has a wife and children somewhere. by hell, i think that's the queerest notion i ever heard! eh?

his whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. the moment they were through the doorway cranly seized him rudely by the neck and shook him, saying:

—you flaming floundering fool! i'll take my dying bible there isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the whole flaming bloody world!

temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, while cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake:

—a flaming flaring bloody idiot!

they crossed the weedy garden together. the president, wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them along one of the walks, reading his office. at the end of the walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. the students saluted, temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. they walked forward in silence. as they neared the alley stephen could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks of the ball and davin's voice crying out excitedly at each stroke

the three students halted round the box on which davin sat to follow the game. temple, after a few moments, sidled across to stephen and said:

—excuse me, i wanted to ask you, do you believe that jean-jacques rousseau was a sincere man?

stephen laughed outright. cranly, picking up the broken stave of a cask from the grass at his feet, turned swiftly and said sternly:

—temple, i declare to the living god if you say another word, do you know, to anybody on any subject, i'll kill you super spottum

—he was like you, i fancy, said stephen, an emotional man

—blast him, curse him! said cranly broadly. don't talk to him at all. sure, you might as well be talking, do you know, to a flaming chamber-pot as talking to temple. go home, temple. for god's sake, go home

—i don't care a damn about you, cranly, answered temple, moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at stephen. he's the only man i see in this institution that has an individual mind

—institution! individual! cried cranly. go home, blast you, for you're a hopeless bloody man

—i'm an emotional man, said temple. that's quite rightly expressed. and i'm proud that i'm an emotionalist

he sidled out of the alley, smiling slyly. cranly watched him with a blank expressionless face

—look at him! he said. did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall?

his phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. the laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. the student's body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins

—lynch is awake, said cranly

lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward his chest

—lynch puts out his chest, said stephen, as a criticism of life

lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said:

—who has anything to say about my girth?

cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. when their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart, panting. stephen bent down towards davin who, intent on the game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others

—and how is my little tame goose? he asked. did he sign, too?

david nodded and said:

—and you, stevie?

stephen shook his head

—you're a terrible man, stevie, said davin, taking the short pipe from his mouth, always alone

—now that you have signed the petition for universal peace, said stephen, i suppose you will burn that little copybook i saw in your room

as davin did not answer, stephen began to quote:

—long pace, fianna! right incline, fianna! fianna, by numbers, salute, one, two!

—that's a different question, said davin. i'm an irish nationalist, first and foremost. but that's you all out. you're a born sneerer, stevie

—when you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. i can find you a few in this college

—i can't understand you, said davin. one time i hear you talk against english literature. now you talk against the irish informers. what with your name and your ideas—are you irish at all?

—come with me now to the office of arms and i will show you the tree of my family, said stephen

—then be one of us, said davin. why don't you learn irish? why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson?

—you know one reason why, answered stephen

davin tossed his head and laughed

—oh, come now, he said. is it on account of that certain young lady and father moran? but that's all in your own mind, stevie. they were only talking and laughing

stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon davin's shoulder

—do you remember, he said, when we knew each other first? the first morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on the first syllable. you remember? then you used to address the jesuits as father, you remember? i ask myself about you: is he as innocent as his speech?

—i'm a simple person, said davin. you know that. when you told me that night in harcourt street those things about your private life, honest to god, stevie, i was not able to eat my dinner. i was quite bad. i was awake a long time that night. why did you tell me those things?

—thanks, said stephen. you mean i am a monster

—no, said davin. but i wish you had not told me

a tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of stephen's friendliness

—this race and this country and this life produced me, he said i shall express myself as i am

—try to be one of us, repeated davin. in heart you are an irish man but your pride is too powerful

—my ancestors threw off their language and took another stephen said. they allowed a handful of foreigners to subject them. do you fancy i am going to pay in my own life and person debts they made? what for?

—for our freedom, said davin

—no honourable and sincere man, said stephen, has given up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of tone to those of parnell, but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another. and you invite me to be one of you. i'd see you damned first

—they died for their ideals, stevie, said davin. our day will come yet, believe me

stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an instant

—the soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments i told you of. it has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than the birth of the body. when the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. you talk to me of nationality, language, religion. i shall try to fly by those nets

davin knocked the ashes from his pipe

—too deep for me, stevie, he said. but a man's country comes first. ireland first, stevie. you can be a poet or a mystic after

—do you know what ireland is? asked stephen with cold violence. ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow

davin rose from his box and went towards the players, shaking his head sadly. but in a moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputing with cranly and the two players who had finished their game. a match of four was arranged, cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. he let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer to its thud:

—your soul!

stephen stood with lynch till the score began to rise. then he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. lynch obeyed, saying:

—let us eke go, as cranly has it

stephen smiled at this side-thrust

they passed back through the garden and out through the hall where the doddering porter was pinning up a hall notice in the frame. at the foot of the steps they halted and stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and offered it to his companion

—i know you are poor, he said

—damn your yellow insolence, answered lynch

this second proof of lynch's culture made stephen smile again

—it was a great day for european culture, he said, when you made up your mind to swear in yellow

they lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. after a pause stephen began:

—aristotle has not defined pity and terror. i have. i say—

lynch halted and said bluntly:

—stop! i won't listen! i am sick. i was out last night on a yellow drunk with horan and goggins

stephen went on:

—pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the human sufferer. terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret cause

—repeat, said lynch

stephen repeated the definitions slowly

—a girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in london. she was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years. at the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a star. a long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. she died on the instant. the reporter called it a tragic death. it is not. it is remote from terror and pity according to the terms of my definitions

—the tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of it. you see i use the word arrest. i mean that the tragic emotion is static. or rather the dramatic emotion is. the feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. the arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. the esthetic emotion (i used the general term) is therefore static. the mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing

—you say that art must not excite desire, said lynch. i told you that one day i wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the venus of praxiteles in the museum. was that not desire?

—i speak of normal natures, said stephen. you also told me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung

lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets

—o, i did! i did! he cried

stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment boldly in the eyes. lynch, recovering from his laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. the long slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought before stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. the eyes, too, were reptile-like in glint and gaze. yet at that instant, humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and self-embittered

—as for that, stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all animals. i also am an animal

—you are, said lynch

—but we are just now in a mental world, stephen continued. the desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also because they are not more than physical. our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nervous system. our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is about to enter our eye

—not always, said lynch critically

—in the same way, said stephen, your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue, but it was, i say, simply a reflex action of the nerves. beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical. it awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged, and at last dissolved by what i call the rhythm of beauty

—what is that exactly? asked lynch

—rhythm, said stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part

—if that is rhythm, said lynch, let me hear what you call beauty; and, please remember, though i did eat a cake of cowdung once, that i admire only beauty

stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. then, blushing slightly, he laid his hand on lynch's thick tweed sleeve

—we are right, he said, and the others are wrong. to speak of these things and to try to understand their nature and, having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come to understand—that is art

they had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went on by the trees. a crude grey light, mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of stephen's thought

—but you have not answered my question, said lynch. what is art? what is the beauty it expresses?

—that was the first definition i gave you, you sleepy-headed wretch, said stephen, when i began to try to think out the matter for myself. do you remember the night? cranly lost his temper and began to talk about wicklow bacon

—i remember, said lynch. he told us about them flaming fat devils of pigs

—art, said stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end. you remember the pigs and forget that. you are a distressing pair, you and cranly

lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said:

—if i am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least another cigarette. i don't care about it. i don't even care about women. damn you and damn everything. i want a job of five hundred a year. you can't get me one

stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. lynch took the last one that remained, saying simply:

—proceed!

—aquinas, said stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension of which pleases

lynch nodded

—i remember that, he said, pulcra sunt quae visa placent

—he uses the word visa, said stephen, to cover esthetic apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension. this word, though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing. it means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis. how about the true? it produces also a stasis of the mind. you would not write your name in pencil across the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle

—no, said lynch, give me the hypotenuse of the venus of praxiteles

—static therefore, said stephen. plato, i believe, said that beauty is the splendour of truth. i don't think that it has a meaning, but the true and the beautiful are akin. truth is beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible; beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sensible. the first step in the direction of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act itself of intellection. aristotle's entire system of philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, i think, rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject. the first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension. is that clear?

—but what is beauty? asked lynch impatiently. out with another definition. something we see and like! is that the best you and aquinas can do?

—let us take woman, said stephen

—let us take her! said lynch fervently

—the greek, the turk, the chinese, the copt, the hottentot, said stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. that seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. i see, however, two ways out. one is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species. it may be so. the world, it seems, is drearier than even you, lynch, imagined. for my part i dislike that way out. it leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. it leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lecture-room where maccann, with one hand on the origin of species and the other hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours

—then maccann is a sulphur-yellow liar, said lynch energetically

—there remains another way out, said stephen, laughing

—to wit? said lynch

—this hypothesis, stephen began

a long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of sir patrick dun's hospital covering the end of stephen's speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed. then he turned on his heel rudely. stephen turned also and waited for a few moments till his companion's ill-humour had had its vent

—this hypothesis, stephen repeated, is the other way out: that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic apprehension. these relations of the sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty. now, we can return to our old friend saint thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom

lynch laughed

—it amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time after time like a jolly round friar. are you laughing in your sleeve?

—macalister, answered stephen, would call my esthetic theory applied aquinas. so far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends, aquinas will carry me all along the line. when we come to the phenomena of artistic conception, artistic gestation, and artistic reproduction i require a new terminology and a new personal experience

—of course, said lynch. after all aquinas, in spite of his intellect, was exactly a good round friar. but you will tell me about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day. hurry up and finish the first part

—who knows? said stephen, smiling. perhaps aquinas would understand me better than you. he was a poet himself. he wrote a hymn for maundy thursday. it begins with the words pange lingua gloriosi. they say it is the highest glory of the hymnal. it is an intricate and soothing hymn. i like it; but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic processional song, the vexilla regis of venantius fortunatus

lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice:

impleta sunt quae concinit
david fideli carmine
dicendo nationibus
regnavit a ligno deus

—that's great! he said, well pleased. great music!

they turned into lower mount street. a few steps from the corner a fat young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them and stopped

—did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. griffin was plucked. halpin and o'flynn are through the home civil. moonan got fifth place in the indian. o'shaughnessy got fourteenth. the irish fellows in clark's gave them a feed last night. they all ate curry

his pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small fat-encircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing voice out of hearing

in reply to a question of stephen's his eyes and his voice came forth again from their lurking-places

—yes, maccullagh and i, he said. he's taking pure mathematics and i'm taking constitutional history. there are twenty subjects. i'm taking botany too. you know i'm a member of the field club

he drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and placed a plump woollen-gloved hand on his breast from which muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth

—bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go out, said stephen drily, to make a stew

the fat student laughed indulgently and said:

—we are all highly respectable people in the field club. last saturday we went out to glenmalure, seven of us

—with women, donovan? said lynch

donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said:

—our end is the acquisition of knowledge. then he said quickly:

—i hear you are writing some essays about esthetics

stephen made a vague gesture of denial

—goethe and lessing, said donovan, have written a lot on that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and all that. the laocoon interested me very much when i read it. of course it is idealistic, german, ultra-profound

neither of the others spoke. donovan took leave of them urbanely

—i must go, he said softly and benevolently, i have a strong suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my sister intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the donovan family

—goodbye, stephen said in his wake. don't forget the turnips for me and my mate

lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his face resembled a devil's mask:

—to think that that yellow pancake-eating excrement can get a good job, he said at length, and i have to smoke cheap cigarettes!

they turned their faces towards merrion square and went for a little in silence

—to finish what i was saying about beauty, said stephen, the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore correspond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension. find these and you find the qualities of universal beauty. aquinas says: ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur integritas, consonantia, claritas. i translate it so: three things are needed for beauty, wholeness, harmony, and radiance. do these correspond to the phases of apprehension? are you following?

—of course, i am, said lynch. if you think i have an excrementitious intelligence run after donovan and ask him to listen to you

stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had slung inverted on his head

—look at that basket, he said

—i see it, said lynch

—in order to see that basket, said stephen, your mind first of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not the basket. the first phase of apprehension is a bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. an esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time

what is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented in space. but, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is not it. you apprehended it as one thing. you see it as one whole. you apprehend its wholeness. that is integritas

—bull's eye! said lynch, laughing. go on

—then, said stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. in other words, the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of apprehension. having first felt that it is one thing you feel now that it is a thing. you apprehend it as complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious. that is consonantia

—bull's eye again! said lynch wittily. tell me now what is claritas and you win the cigar

—the connotation of the word, stephen said, is rather vague. aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. it baffled me for a long time. it would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world, the idea of which the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the symbol. i thought he might mean that claritas is the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. but that is literary talk. i understand it so. when you have apprehended that basket as one thing and have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permissible. you see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing. the radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic quidditas, the whatness of a thing. this supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. the mind in that mysterious instant shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal. the instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the italian physiologist luigi galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as shelley's, called the enchantment of the heart

stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his words had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence

—what i have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition. in the marketplace it has another sense. when we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art. the image, it is clear, must be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the mind or senses of others. if you bear this in memory you will see that art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one to the next. these forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others

—that you told me a few nights ago, said lynch, and we began the famous discussion

—i have a book at home, said stephen, in which i have written down questions which are more amusing than yours were. in finding the answers to them i found the theory of esthetic which i am trying to explain. here are some questions i set myself: is a chair finely made tragic or comic? is the portrait of mona lisa good if i desire to see it? if not, why not?

—why not, indeed? said lynch, laughing

—if a man hacking in fury at a block of wood, stephen continued, make there an image of a cow, is that image a work of art? if not, why not?

—that's a lovely one, said lynch, laughing again. that has the true scholastic stink

—lessing, said stephen, should not have taken a group of statues to write of. the art, being inferior, does not present the forms i spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. even in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are often confused. the lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged stones up a slope. he who utters it is more conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. the simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from others. the narrative is no longer purely personal. the personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. this progress you will see easily in that old english ballad turpin hero which begins in the first person and ends in the third person. the dramatic form is reached when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. the personality of the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative, finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalizes itself, so to speak. the esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. the mystery of esthetic, like that of material creation, is accomplished. the artist, like the god of creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails

—trying to refine them also out of existence, said lynch

a fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned into the duke's lawn to reach the national library before the shower came

—what do you mean, lynch asked surlily, by prating about beauty and the imagination in this miserable godforsaken island? no wonder the artist retired within or behind his handiwork after having perpetrated this country

the rain fell faster. when they passed through the passage beside kildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade of the library. cranly, leaning against a pillar, was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, listening to some companions. some girls stood near the entrance door. lynch whispered to stephen:

—your beloved is here

stephen took his place silently on the step below the group of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes towards her from time to time. she too stood silently among her companions. she has no priest to flirt with, he thought with conscious bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last. lynch was right. his mind emptied of theory and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace

he heard the students talking among themselves. they spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical examination, of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of poor and rich practices

—that's all a bubble. an irish country practice is better

—hynes was two years in liverpool and he says the same. a frightful hole he said it was. nothing but midwifery cases

—do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the country than in a rich city like that? i know a fellow...

—hynes has no brains. he got through by stewing, pure stewing

—don't mind him. there's plenty of money to be made in a big commercial city

—depends on the practice

—ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox, simpliciter sanguinarius atrox, in liverpoolio

their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in interrupted pulsation. she was preparing to go away with her companions

the quick light shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the blackened earth. their trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade, talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, closing them again, holding their skirts demurely

and if he had judged her harshly? if her life were a simple rosary of hours, her life simple and strange as a bird's life, gay in the morning, restless all day, tired at sundown? her heart simple and wilful as a bird's heart?

        ———

towards dawn he awoke. o what sweet music! his soul was all dewy wet. over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed. he lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of faint sweet music. his mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. a spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. but how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! his soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. it was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies forth silently

an enchantment of the heart! the night had been enchanted. in a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life. was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?

the instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstances of what had happened or of what might have happened. the instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow. o! in the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber. an afterglow deepened within his spirit, whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and ardent light. that rose and ardent light was her strange wilful heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful from before the beginning of the world; and lured by that ardent rose-like glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling from heaven

    are you not weary of ardent ways
    lure of the fallen seraphim?
    tell no more of enchanted days

the verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through them. the rose-like glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. its rays burned up the world, consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose that was her wilful heart

    your eyes have set man's heart ablaze
    and you have had your will of him
    are you not weary of ardent ways?

and then? the rhythm died away, ceased, began again to move and beat. and then? smoke, incense ascending from the altar of the world

    above the flame the smoke of praise
    goes up from ocean rim to rim
    tell no more of enchanted days

smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury oceans, smoke of her praise. the earth was like a swinging swaying censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal fall. the rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. his lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and baffled; then stopped. the heart's cry was broken

the veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes of the naked window the morning light was gathering. a bell beat faintly very far away. a bird twittered; two birds, three. the bell and the bird ceased; and the dull white light spread itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight in his heart

fearing to lose all, he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to look for paper and pencil. there was neither on the table; only the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, singed by the last flame. he stretched his arm wearily towards the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the coat that hung there. his fingers found a pencil and then a cigarette packet. he lay back and, tearing open the packet, placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the rough cardboard surface

having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, murmuring them again. the lumps of knotted flock under his head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with himself, confounded by the print of the sacred heart above the untenanted sideboard. he saw her approach him in a lull of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. then he saw himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the victory chant of agincourt, the happy air of greensleeves. while he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their christian names a little too soon

at certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain. she passed now dancing lightly across his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball, her white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. she danced lightly in the round. she was dancing towards him and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was on her cheek. at the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise

—you are a great stranger now

—yes. i was born to be a monk

—i am afraid you are a heretic

—are you much afraid?

for answer she had danced away from him along the chain of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none. the white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek

a monk! his own image started forth a profaner of the cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, spinning like gherardino da borgo san donnino, a lithe web of sophistry and whispering in her ear

no, it was not his image. it was like the image of the young priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her irish phrase-book

—yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. i can see it every day. the ladies are with us. the best helpers the language has

—and the church, father moran?

—the church too. coming round too. the work is going ahead there too. don't fret about the church

bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. he had done well not to salute her on the steps of the library! he had done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a church which was the scullery-maid of christendom

rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from his soul. it broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides. on all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen-girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates, with the drawl of a country singer, the first bars of by killarney's lakes and fells, a girl who had laughed gaily to see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near cork hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed out of jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoulder:

—do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly eyebrows?

and yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her image, his anger was also a form of homage. he had left the classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. he had told himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a figure of the womanhood of her country, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness, tarrying awhile, loveless and sinless, with her mild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the latticed ear of a priest. his anger against her found vent in coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a brother a policeman in dublin and a brother a potboy in moycullen. to him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to him, a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life

the radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving

    our broken cries and mournful lays
      rise in one eucharistic hymn
    are you not weary of ardent ways?
      while sacrificing hands upraise
      the chalice flowing to the brim
    tell no more of enchanted days

he spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing them; then lay back on his bolster

the full morning light had come. no sound was to be heard; but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper. he tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers. weary! weary! he too was weary of ardent ways

a gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over him descending along his spine from his closely cowled head. he felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. soon he would sleep

he had written verses for her again after ten years. ten years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping her foot upon the glassy road. it was the last tram; the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. the conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light of the lamp. they stood on the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. she came up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down. let be! let be!

ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. if he sent her the verses? they would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping of egg-shells. folly indeed! her brothers would laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their strong hard fingers. the suave priest, her uncle, seated in his arm-chair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it smiling and approve of the literary form

no, no; that was folly. even if he sent her the verses she would not show them to others. no, no; she could not

he began to feel that he had wronged her. a sense of her innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her nature had first come upon her. then first her soul had begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned, and a tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame of womanhood

while his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been? might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his homage? it might be

a glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and fulfilled all his body. conscious of his desire she was waking from odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. her eyes, dark and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. her nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavish-limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like water with a liquid life; and like a cloud of vapour or like waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, symbols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his brain

    are you not weary of ardent ways
    lure of the fallen seraphim?
    tell no more of enchanted days

    your eyes have set man's heart ablaze
    and you have had your will of him
    are you not weary of ardent ways?

    above the flame the smoke of praise
    goes up from ocean rim to rim
    tell no more of enchanted days

    our broken cries and mournful lays
    rise in one eucharistic hymn
    are you not weary of ardent ways?

    while sacrificing hands upraise
    the chalice flowing to the brim
    tell no more of enchanted days

    and still you hold our longing gaze
    with languorous look and lavish limb!
    are you not weary of ardent ways?
    tell no more of enchanted days

what birds were they? he stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning wearily on his ashplant. they flew round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in molesworth street. the air of the late march evening made clear their flight, their dark quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a limp-hung cloth of smoky tenuous blue

he watched their flight; bird after bird: a dark flash, a swerve, a flutter of wings. he tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in number. twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from the upper sky. they were flying high and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air

he listened to the cries: like the squeak of mice behind the wainscot: a shrill twofold note. but the notes were long and shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. their cry was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken light unwound from whirring spools

the inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes which still saw the image of his mother's face

why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? for an augury of good or evil? a phrase of cornelius agrippa flew through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless thoughts from swedenborg on the correspondence of birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have not perverted that order by reason

and for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight. the colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. a sense of fear of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of symbols and portents, of the hawk-like man whose name he bore soaring out of his captivity on osier-woven wings, of thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon

he smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him think of a bottle-nosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a document which he held at arm's length, and he knew that he would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like an irish oath. it was folly. but was it for this folly that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into which he had been born and the order of life out of which he had come?

they came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of the house, flying darkly against the fading air. what birds were they? he thought that they must be swallows who had come back from the south. then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander

bend down your faces, oona and aleel
i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes
upon the nest under the eave before
he wander the loud waters

a soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic silence, of swallows flying through the sea-dusk over the flowing waters

a soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in mute chime and mute peal, and soft low swooning cry; and he felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his heart like a bird from a turret, quietly and swiftly

symbol of departure or of loneliness? the verses crooned in the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the national theatre. he was alone at the side of the balcony, looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of dublin in the stalls and at the tawdry scene-cloths and human dolls framed by the garish lamps of the stage. a burly policeman sweated behind him and seemed at every moment about to act. the catcalls and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall from his scattered fellow students

—a libel on ireland!

—made in germany

—blasphemy!

—we never sold our faith!

—no irish woman ever did it!

—we want no amateur atheists

—we want no budding buddhists

a sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the reader's room. he turned into the pillared hall, now calmly lit, went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile

cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. a thick book, opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. he leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to him a problem from the chess page of a journal. stephen sat down at his right and the priest at the other side of the table closed his copy of the tablet with an angry snap and stood up

cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. the medical student went on in a softer voice:

—pawn to king's fourth

—we had better go, dixon, said stephen in warning. he has gone to complain

dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying:

—our men retired in good order

—with guns and cattle, added stephen, pointing to the titlepage of cranly's book on which was printed diseases of the ox

as they passed through a lane of the tables stephen said:

—cranly, i want to speak to you

cranly did not answer or turn. he laid his book on the counter and passed out, his well-shod feet sounding flatly on the floor. on the staircase he paused and gazing absently at dixon repeated:

—pawn to king's bloody fourth

—put it that way if you like, dixon said

he had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a signet ring

as they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came towards them. under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur. the eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey

—good evening, gentlemen, said the stubble-grown monkeyish face

—warm weather for march, said cranly. they have the windows open upstairs

dixon smiled and turned his ring. the blackish, monkey-puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purred:

—delightful weather for march. simply delightful

—there are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of waiting, dixon said

cranly smiled and said kindly:

—the captain has only one love: sir walter scott. isn't that so, captain?

—what are you reading now, captain? dixon asked. the bride of lammermoor?

—i love old scott, the flexible lips said, i think he writes something lovely. there is no writer can touch sir walter scott

he moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his sad eyes

sadder to stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low and moist, marred by errors, and, listening to it, he wondered was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous love?

the park trees were heavy with rain; and rain fell still and ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. a game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their green-white slime. they embraced softly, impelled by the grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shield-like witnessing lake, the swans. they embraced without joy or passion, his arm about his sister's neck. a grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame. he had loose red-brown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. face? there was no face seen. the brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair. the hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was davin's hand

he frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin who had called it forth. his father's jibes at the bantry gang leaped out of his memory. he held them at a distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. why were they not cranly's hands? had davin's simplicity and innocence stung him more secretly?

he walked on across the hall with dixon, leaving cranly to take leave elaborately of the dwarf

under the colonnade temple was standing in the midst of a little group of students. one of them cried:

—dixon, come over till you hear. temple is in grand form

temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes

—you're a hypocrite, o'keeffe, he said. and dixon is a smiler. by hell, i think that's a good literary expression

he laughed slyly, looking in stephen's face, repeating:

—by hell, i'm delighted with that name. a smiler

a stout student who stood below them on the steps said:

—come back to the mistress, temple. we want to hear about that

—he had, faith, temple said. and he was a married man too. and all the priests used to be dining there. by hell, i think they all had a touch

—we shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said dixon

—tell us, temple, o'keeffe said, how many quarts of porter have you in you?

—all your intellectual soul is in that phrase, o'keeffe, said temple with open scorn

he moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke to stephen

—did you know that the forsters are the kings of belgium? he asked

cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth with care

—and here's the wiseacre, said temple. do you know that about the forsters?

he paused for an answer. cranly dislodged a figseed from his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently

—the forster family, temple said, is descended from baldwin the first, king of flanders. he was called the forester. forester and forster are the same name. a descendant of baldwin the first, captain francis forster, settled in ireland and married the daughter of the last chieftain of clanbrassil. then there are the blake forsters. that's a different branch

—from baldhead, king of flanders, cranly repeated, rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth

—where did you pick up all that history? o'keeffe asked

—i know all the history of your family, too, temple said, turning to stephen. do you know what giraldus cambrensis says about your family?

—is he descended from baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive student with dark eyes

—baldhead, cranly repeated, sucking at a crevice in his teeth

—pernobilis et pervetusta familia, temple said to stephen

the stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly. dixon turned towards him, saying in a soft voice:

—did an angel speak?

cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger:

—goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil i ever met, do you know

—i had it on my mind to say that, goggins answered firmly. it did no one any harm, did it?

—we hope, dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind known to science as a paulo post futurum

—didn't i tell you he was a smiler? said temple, turning right and left. didn't i give him that name?

—you did. we're not deaf, said the tall consumptive

cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. then, with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps

—go away from here, he said rudely. go away, you stinkpot. and you are a stinkpot

goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his place with good humour. temple turned back to stephen and asked:

—do you believe in the law of heredity?

—are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to say? asked cranly, facing round on him with an expression of wonder

—the most profound sentence ever written, temple said with enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. reproduction is the beginning of death

he touched stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly:

—do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet?

cranly pointed his long forefinger

—look at him! he said with scorn to the others. look at ireland's hope!

they laughed at his words and gesture. temple turned on him bravely, saying:

—cranly, you're always sneering at me. i can see that. but i am as good as you any day. do you know what i think about you now as compared with myself?

—my dear man, said cranly urbanely, you are incapable, do you know, absolutely incapable of thinking

—but do you know, temple went on, what i think of you and of myself compared together?

—out with it, temple! the stout student cried from the steps. get it out in bits!

temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures as he spoke

—i'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. i am and i know i am. and i admit it that i am

dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly:

—and it does you every credit, temple

—but he, temple said, pointing to cranly, he is a ballocks, too, like me. only he doesn't know it. and that's the only difference i see

a burst of laughter covered his words. but he turned again to stephen and said with a sudden eagerness:

—that word is a most interesting word. that's the only english dual number. did you know?

—is it? stephen said vaguely

he was watching cranly's firm-featured suffering face, lit up now by a smile of false patience. the gross name had passed over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient of injuries; and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the black hair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown

she passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across stephen in reply to cranly's greeting. he also? was there not a slight flush on cranly's cheek? or had it come forth at temple's words? the light had waned. he could not see

did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often stephen's ardent wayward confessions? stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in himself. and he remembered an evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray to god in a wood near malahide. he had lifted up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. and when two constabulary men had come into sight round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime

he began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a pillar. had cranly not heard him? yet he could wait. the talk about him ceased for a moment and a soft hiss fell again from a window above. but no other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes were sleeping

she had passed through the dusk. and therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell. and therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble. darkness was falling

darkness falls from the air

a trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy host around him. but why? her passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?

he walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of dowland and byrd and nash

eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed the breaking east. what was their languid grace but the softness of chambering? and what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering stuart. and he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan, and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in covent garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the pox-fouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again

the images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. they were secret and inflaming but her image was not entangled by them. that was not the way to think of her. it was not even the way in which he thought of her. could his mind then not trust itself? old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like the figseeds cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth

it was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figure was passing homeward through the city. vaguely first and then more sharply he smelt her body. a conscious unrest seethed in his blood. yes, it was her body he smelt, a wild and languid smell, the tepid limbs over which his music had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her flesh distilled odour and a dew

a louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. he rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die. there came to his mind a curious phrase from cornelius a lapide which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by god with the other animals on the sixth day. but the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. the life of his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell. yes, and it was not darkness that fell from the air. it was brightness

brightness falls from the air

he had not even remembered rightly nash's line. all the images it had awakened were false. his mind bred vermin. his thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth

he came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. well then, let her go and be damned to her! she could love some clean athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. let her

cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. temple sat on the pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his sleepy eyes. a squat young man came out of the porch, a leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. he marched towards the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots and with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. then, raising the umbrella in salute, he said to all:

—good evening, sirs

he struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled with a slight nervous movement. the tall consumptive student and dixon and o'keeffe were speaking in irish and did not answer him. then, turning to cranly, he said:

—good evening, particularly to you

he moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud movements of his jaws

—good? yes. it is a good evening

the squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gently and reprovingly

—i can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious remarks

—um, cranly answered, holding out what remained of the half chewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's mouth in sign that he should eat

the squat student did not eat it but, indulging his special humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase with his umbrella:

—do you intend that...?

he broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig, and said loudly:

—i allude to that

—um, cranly said as before

—do you intend that now, the squat student said, as ipso facto or, let us say, as so to speak?

dixon turned aside from his group, saying:

—goggins was waiting for you, glynn. he has gone round to the adelphi to look for you and moynihan. what have you there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under glynn's arm

—examination papers, glynn answered. i give them monthly examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition

he also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled

—tuition! said cranly rudely. i suppose you mean the barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. god help them!

he bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt

—i suffer little children to come unto me, glynn said amiably

—a bloody ape, cranly repeated with emphasis, and a blasphemous bloody ape!

temple stood up and, pushing past cranly, addressed glynn:

—that phrase you said now, he said, is from the new testament about suffer the children to come to me

—go to sleep again, temple, said o'keeffe

—very well, then, temple continued, still addressing glynn, and if jesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them all to hell if they die unbaptized? why is that?

—were you baptized yourself, temple? the consumptive student asked

—but why are they sent to hell if jesus said they were all to come? temple said, his eyes searching glynn's eyes

glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every word:

—and, as you remark, if it is thus, i ask emphatically whence comes this thusness

—because the church is cruel like all old sinners, temple said

—are you quite orthodox on that point, temple? dixon said suavely

—saint augustine says that about unbaptized children going to hell, temple answered, because he was a cruel old sinner too

—i bow to you, dixon said, but i had the impression that limbo existed for such cases

—don't argue with him, dixon, cranly said brutally. don't talk to him or look at him. lead him home with a sugan the way you'd lead a bleating goat

—limbo! temple cried. that's a fine invention too. like hell

—but with the unpleasantness left out, dixon said

he turned smiling to the others and said:

—i think i am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much

—you are, glynn said in a firm tone. on that point ireland is united

he struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the colonnade

—hell, temple said. i can respect that invention of the grey spouse of satan. hell is roman, like the walls of the romans, strong and ugly. but what is limbo?

—put him back into the perambulator, cranly, o'keeffe called out

cranly made a swift step towards temple, halted, stamping his foot, crying as if to a fowl:

—hoosh!

temple moved away nimbly

—do you know what limbo is? he cried. do you know what we call a notion like that in roscommon?

—hoosh! blast you! cranly cried, clapping his hands

—neither my arse nor my elbow! temple cried out scornfully. and that's what i call limbo

—give us that stick here, cranly said

he snatched the ashplant roughly from stephen's hand and sprang down the steps: but temple, hearing him move in pursuit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and fleet-footed. cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and spurning the gravel at each step

his step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick back into stephen's hand. stephen felt that his anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:

—cranly, i told you i wanted to speak to you. come away

cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:

—now?

—yes, now, stephen said. we can't speak here. come away

they crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. the bird call from siegfried whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch. cranly turned, and dixon, who had whistled, called out:

—where are you fellows off to? what about that game, cranly?

they parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be played in the adelphi hotel. stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of kildare street opposite maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. the name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. he stared angrily back at the softly lit drawing-room of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of ireland housed in calm. they thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted them along the roads in the country; they knew the names of certain french dishes and gave orders to jarvies in high-pitched provincial voices which pierced through their skin-tight accents

how could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the imaginations of their daughters, before their squires begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own? and under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes, under trees by the edges of streams and near the pool-mottled bogs. a woman had waited in the doorway as davin had passed by at night and, offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; for davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret. but him no woman's eyes had wooed

his arm was taken in a strong grip and cranly's voice said:

—let us eke go

they walked southward in silence. then cranly said:

—that blithering idiot, temple! i swear to moses, do you know, that i'll be the death of that fellow one time

but his voice was no longer angry and stephen wondered was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch

they turned to the left and walked on as before. when they had gone on so for some time stephen said:

—cranly, i had an unpleasant quarrel this evening

—with your people? cranly asked

—with my mother

—about religion?

—yes, stephen answered

after a pause cranly asked:

—what age is your mother?

—not old, stephen said. she wishes me to make my easter duty

—and will you?

—i will not, stephen said

—why not? cranly said

—i will not serve, answered stephen

—that remark was made before, cranly said calmly

—it is made behind now, said stephen hotly

cranly pressed stephen's arm, saying:

—go easy, my dear man. you're an excitable bloody man, do you know

he laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into stephen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said:

—do you know that you are an excitable man?

—i daresay i am, said stephen, laughing also

their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been drawn closer, one to the other

—do you believe in the eucharist? cranly asked

—i do not, stephen said

—do you disbelieve then?

—i neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, stephen answered

—many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet they overcome them or put them aside, cranly said. are your doubts on that point too strong?

—i do not wish to overcome them, stephen answered

cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from his pocket and was about to eat it when stephen said:

—don't, please. you cannot discuss this question with your mouth full of chewed fig

cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted. then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter

addressing it as it lay, he said:

—depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!

taking stephen's arms, he went on again and said:

—do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of judgement?

—what is offered me on the other hand? stephen asked. an eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies?

—remember, cranly said, that he would be glorified

—ay, stephen said somewhat bitterly, bright, agile, impassible and, above all, subtle

—it is a curious thing, do you know, cranly said dispassionately, how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelieve. did you believe in it when you were at school? i bet you did

—i did, stephen answered

—and were you happier then? cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?

—often happy, stephen said, and often unhappy. i was someone else then

—how someone else? what do you mean by that statement?

—i mean, said stephen, that i was not myself as i am now, as i had to become

—not as you are now, not as you had to become, cranly repeated. let me ask you a question. do you love your mother?

stephen shook his head slowly

—i don't know what your words mean, he said simply

—have you never loved anyone? cranly asked

—do you mean women?

—i am not speaking of that, cranly said in a colder tone. i ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything?

stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the footpath

—i tried to love god, he said at length. it seems now i failed. it is very difficult. i tried to unite my will with the will of god instant by instant. in that i did not always fail. i could perhaps do that still—

cranly cut him short by asking:

—has your mother had a happy life?

—how do i know? stephen said

—how many children had she?

—nine or ten, stephen answered. some died

—was your father... cranly interrupted himself for an instant, and then said: i don't want to pry into your family affairs. but was your father what is called well-to-do? i mean, when you were growing up?

—yes, stephen said

—what was he? cranly asked after a pause

stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes

—a medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a drinker, a good fellow, a story-teller, somebody's secretary, something in a distillery, a tax-gatherer, a bankrupt and at present a praiser of his own past

cranly laughed, tightening his grip on stephen's arm, and said:

—the distillery is damn good

—is there anything else you want to know? stephen asked

—are you in good circumstances at present?

—do i look it? stephen asked bluntly

—so then, cranly went on musingly, you were born in the lap of luxury

he used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used technical expressions, as if he wished his hearer to understand that they were used by him without conviction

—your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffering, he said then. would you not try to save her from suffering more even if... or would you?

—if i could, stephen said, that would cost me very little

—then do so, cranly said. do as she wishes you to do. what is it for you? you disbelieve in it. it is a form: nothing else. and you will set her mind at rest

he ceased and, as stephen did not reply, remained silent. then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought, he said:

—whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not. your mother brings you into the world, carries you first in her body. what do we know about what she feels? but whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. it must be. what are our ideas or ambitions? play. ideas! why, that bloody bleating goat temple has ideas. maccann has ideas too. every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas

stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the words, said with assumed carelessness:

—pascal, if i remember rightly, would not suffer his mother to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex

—pascal was a pig, said cranly

—aloysius gonzaga, i think, was of the same mind, stephen said

—and he was another pig then, said cranly

—the church calls him a saint, stephen objected

—i don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, cranly said rudely and flatly. i call him a pig

stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued:

—jesus, too, seems to have treated his mother with scant courtesy in public but suarez, a jesuit theologian and spanish gentleman, has apologized for him

—did the idea ever occur to you, cranly asked, that jesus was not what he pretended to be?

—the first person to whom that idea occurred, stephen answered, was jesus himself

—i mean, cranly said, hardening in his speech, did the idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite, what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? or, to put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard?

—that idea never occurred to me, stephen answered. but i am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself?

he turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant

cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone:

—tell me the truth. were you at all shocked by what i said?

—somewhat, stephen said

—and why were you shocked, cranly pressed on in the same tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that jesus was not the son of god?

—i am not at all sure of it, stephen said. he is more like a son of god than a son of mary

—and is that why you will not communicate, cranly asked, because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the host, too, may be the body and blood of the son of god and not a wafer of bread? and because you fear that it may be?

—yes, stephen said quietly, i feel that and i also fear it

—i see, cranly said

stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion at once by saying:

—i fear many things: dogs, horses, fire-arms, the sea, thunder-storms, machinery, the country roads at night

—but why do you fear a bit of bread?

—i imagine, stephen said, that there is a malevolent reality behind those things i say i fear

—do you fear then, cranly asked, that the god of the roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a sacrilegious communion?

—the god of the roman catholics could do that now, stephen said. i fear more than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration

—would you, cranly asked, in extreme danger, commit that particular sacrilege? for instance, if you lived in the penal days?

—i cannot answer for the past, stephen replied. possibly not

—then, said cranly, you do not intend to become a protestant?

—i said that i had lost the faith, stephen answered, but not that i had lost self-respect. what kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which is illogical and incoherent?

they had walked on towards the township of pembroke and now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees and the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. the air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their neediness. behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard singing as she sharpened knives. she sang, in short broken bars:

rosie o'grady

cranly stopped to listen, saying:

—mulier cantat

the soft beauty of the latin word touched with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's hand. the strife of their minds was quelled. the figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the darkness: a white-robed figure, small and slender as a boy, and with a falling girdle. her voice, frail and high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion:

—et tu cum jesu galilaeo eras

and all hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxytone and more faintly as the cadence died

the singing ceased. they went on together, cranly repeating in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain:

and when we are married
o, how happy we'll be
for i love sweet rosie o'grady
and rosie o'grady loves me

—there's real poetry for you, he said. there's real love

he glanced sideways at stephen with a strange smile and said:

—do you consider that poetry? or do you know what the words mean?

—i want to see rosie first, said stephen

—she's easy to find, cranly said

his hat had come down on his forehead. he shoved it back and in the shadow of the trees stephen saw his pale face, framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. yes. his face was handsome and his body was strong and hard. he had spoken of a mother's love. he felt then the sufferings of women, the weaknesses of their bodies and souls; and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them

away then: it is time to go. a voice spoke softly to stephen's lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end. yes; he would go. he could not strive against another. he knew his part

—probably i shall go away, he said

—where? cranly asked

—where i can, stephen said

—yes, cranly said. it might be difficult for you to live here now. but is it that makes you go?

—i have to go, stephen answered

—because, cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw. there are many good believers who think as you do. would that surprise you? the church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. it is the whole mass of those born into it. i don't know what you wish to do in life. is it what you told me the night we were standing outside harcourt street station?

—yes, stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at cranly's way of remembering thoughts in connexion with places. the night you spent half an hour wrangling with doherty about the shortest way from sallygap to larras

—pothead! cranly said with calm contempt. what does he know about the way from sallygap to larras? or what does he know about anything for that matter? and the big slobbering washing-pot head of him!

he broke into a loud long laugh

—well? stephen said. do you remember the rest?

—what you said, is it? cranly asked. yes, i remember it. to discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom

stephen raised his hat in acknowledgement

—freedom! cranly repeated. but you are not free enough yet to commit a sacrilege. tell me would you rob?

—i would beg first, stephen said

—and if you got nothing, would you rob?

—you wish me to say, stephen answered, that the rights of property are provisional, and that in certain circumstances it is not unlawful to rob. everyone would act in that belief. so i will not make you that answer. apply to the jesuit theologian, juan mariana de talavera, who will also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow. ask me rather would i suffer others to rob me, or if they did, would i call down upon them what i believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm?

—and would you?

—i think, stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so as to be robbed

—i see, cranly said

he produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth. then he said carelessly:

—tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin?

—excuse me, stephen said politely, is that not the ambition of most young gentlemen?

—what then is your point of view? cranly asked

his last phrase, sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal and disheartening, excited stephen's brain, over which its fumes seemed to brood

—look here, cranly, he said. you have asked me what i would do and what i would not do. i will tell you what i will do and what i will not do. i will not serve that in which i no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and i will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as i can and as wholly as i can, using for my defence the only arms i allow myself to use—silence, exile, and cunning

cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him back towards leeson park. he laughed almost slyly and pressed stephen's arm with an elder's affection

—cunning indeed! he said. is it you? you poor poet, you!

—and you made me confess to you, stephen said, thrilled by his touch, as i have confessed to you so many other things, have i not?

—yes, my child, cranly said, still gaily

—you made me confess the fears that i have. but i will tell you also what i do not fear. i do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever i have to leave. and i am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too

cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said:

—alone, quite alone. you have no fear of that. and you know what that word means? not only to be separate from all others but to have not even one friend

—i will take the risk, said stephen

—and not to have any one person, cranly said, who would be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had

his words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? stephen watched his face for some moments in silence. a cold sadness was there. he had spoken of himself, of his own loneliness which he feared

—of whom are you speaking? stephen asked at length

cranly did not answer

march 20. long talk with cranly on the subject of my revolt

he had his grand manner on. i supple and suave. attacked me on the score of love for one's mother. tried to imagine his mother: cannot. told me once, in a moment of thoughtlessness, his father was sixty-one when he was born. can see him. strong farmer type. pepper and salt suit. square feet. unkempt, grizzled beard. probably attends coursing matches. pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to father dwyer of larras. sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. but his mother? very young or very old? hardly the first. if so, cranly would not have spoken as he did. old then. probably, and neglected. hence cranly's despair of soul: the child of exhausted loins

march 21, morning. thought this in bed last night but was too lazy and free to add to it. free, yes. the exhausted loins are those of elizabeth and zacchary. then he is the precursor. item: he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. read locusts and wild honey. also, when thinking of him, saw always a stern severed head or death mask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica. decollation they call it in the gold. puzzled for the moment by saint john at the latin gate. what do i see? a decollated percursor trying to pick the lock

march 21, night. free. soul free and fancy free. let the dead bury the dead. ay. and let the dead marry the dead

march 22. in company with lynch followed a sizeable hospital nurse. lynch's idea. dislike it. two lean hungry greyhounds walking after a heifer

march 23. have not seen her since that night. unwell? sits at the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. but not peevish. a nice bowl of gruel? won't you now?

march 24. began with a discussion with my mother. subject: b.v.m. handicapped by my sex and youth. to escape held up relations between jesus and papa against those between mary and her son. said religion was not a lying-in hospital. mother indulgent. said i have a queer mind and have read too much. not true. have read little and understood less. then she said i would come back to faith because i had a restless mind. this means to leave church by back door of sin and re-enter through the skylight of repentance. cannot repent. told her so and asked for sixpence. got threepence

then went to college. other wrangle with little round head rogue's eye ghezzi. this time about bruno the nolan. began in italian and ended in pidgin english. he said bruno was a terrible heretic. i said he was terribly burned. he agreed to this with some sorrow. then gave me recipe for what he calls risotto alla bergamasca. when he pronounces a soft o he protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. has he? and could he repent? yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's tears, one from each eye

crossing stephen's, that is, my green, remembered that his countrymen and not mine had invented what cranly the other night called our religion. a quartet of them, soldiers of the ninety-seventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified

went to library. tried to read three reviews. useless. she is not out yet. am i alarmed? about what? that she will never be out again

blake wrote:

i wonder if william bond will die
for assuredly he is very ill

alas, poor william!

i was once at a diorama in rotunda. at the end were pictures of big nobs. among them william ewart gladstone, just then dead. orchestra played o willie, we have missed you

a race of clodhoppers!

march 25, morning. a troubled night of dreams. want to get them off my chest

a long curving gallery. from the floor ascend pillars of dark vapours. it is peopled by the images of fabulous kings, set in stone. their hands are folded upon their knees in token of weariness and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go up before them for ever as dark vapours

strange figures advance as from a cave. they are not as tall as men. one does not seem to stand quite apart from another. their faces are phosphorescent, with darker streaks. they peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. they do not speak

march 30. this evening cranly was in the porch of the library, proposing a problem to dixon and her brother. a mother let her child fall into the nile. still harping on the mother. a crocodile seized the child. mother asked it back. crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do with the child, eat it or not eat it

this mentality, lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of your mud by the operation of your sun

and mine? is it not too? then into nile mud with it!

april 1. disapprove of this last phrase

april 2. saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in johnston's, mooney and o'brien's. rather, lynx-eyed lynch saw her as we passed. he tells me cranly was invited there by brother. did he bring his crocodile? is he the shining light now? well, i discovered him. i protest i did. shining quietly behind a bushel of wicklow bran

april 3. met davin at the cigar shop opposite findlater's church. he was in a black sweater and had a hurley stick. asked me was it true i was going away and why. told him the shortest way to tara was via holyhead. just then my father came up. introduction. father polite and observant. asked davin if he might offer him some refreshment. davin could not, was going to a meeting. when we came away father told me he had a good honest eye. asked me why i did not join a rowing club. i pretended to think it over. told me then how he broke pennyfeather's heart. wants me to read law. says i was cut out for that. more mud, more crocodiles

april 5. wild spring. scudding clouds. o life! dark stream of swirling bogwater on which apple-trees have cast down their delicate flowers. eyes of girls among the leaves. girls demure and romping. all fair or auburn: no dark ones. they blush better. houpla!

april 6. certainly she remembers the past. lynch says all women do. then she remembers the time of her childhood—and mine, if i was ever a child. the past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. statues of women, if lynch be right, should always be fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts

april 6, later. michael robartes remembers forgotten beauty and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his arms the loveliness which has long faded from the world. not this. not at all. i desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not yet come into the world

april 10. faintly, under the heavy night, through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs upon the road. not so faintly now as they come near the bridge; and in a moment, as they pass the darkened windows, the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. they are heard now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gems, hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's end—what heart? —bearing what tidings?

april 11. read what i wrote last night. vague words for a vague emotion. would she like it? i think so. then i should have to like it also

april 13. that tundish has been on my mind for a long time. i looked it up and find it english and good old blunt english too. damn the dean of studies and his funnel! what did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us. damn him one way or the other!

april 14. john alphonsus mulrennan has just returned from the west of ireland. european and asiatic papers please copy. he told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. old man had red eyes and short pipe. old man spoke irish. mulrennan spoke irish. then old man and mulrennan spoke english. mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. old man sat, listened, smoked, spat. then said:

—ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of the world

i fear him. i fear his red-rimmed horny eyes. it is with him i must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or i lie dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till... till what? till he yield to me? no. i mean no harm

april 15. met her today point blank in grafton street. the crowd brought us together. we both stopped. she asked me why i never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about me. this was only to gain time. asked me was i writing poems? about whom? i asked her. this confused her more and i felt sorry and mean. turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries by dante alighieri. talked rapidly of myself and my plans. in the midst of it unluckily i made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. i must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into the air. people began to look at us. she shook hands a moment after and, in going away, said she hoped i would do what i said

now i call that friendly, don't you?

yes, i liked her today. a little or much? don't know. i liked her and it seems a new feeling to me. then, in that case, all the rest, all that i thought i thought and all that i felt i felt, all the rest before now, in fact... o, give it up, old chap! sleep it off!

april 16. away! away!

the spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. they are held out to say: we are alone—come. and the voices say with them: we are your kinsmen. and the air is thick with their company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth

april 26. mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order. she prays now, she says, that i may learn in my own life and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it feels. amen. so be it. welcome, o life, i go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race
april 27. old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in good stead"
I Only Lie When I Love You|Royal Blood|rock|"
i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound


go ahead, muck about
i got my conscience twisted
pull your hair, make me shout
it's just that you insisted i was good for nothing
like you were onto something


i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you

i only lie when i make a sound


go ahead, pull the plug
broken finger, sticky trigger
now i can't get it off my chest
and now i'm wishing you were someone else
you know i'm up to something
diagnosed, no disease
got a suspicion but you just can't find it up your sleeve
and now i beg the truth be told from someone else
all of that fuss for nothing


i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound

and i'm floating in a most peculiar way
and the stars look very different today


for here am i sitting in a tin can
far above the world
planet earth is blue
and there's nothing i can do


though i'm past 100,000 miles
i'm feeling very still
and i think my spaceship knows which way to go
tell my wife i love her very much
she knows
ground control to major tom
your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
can you hear me, major tom?

down a spiral stairway
like a blackout memory
you prop up your work
like a figure of straw
keeping your ghosts from the garden
but is it red ripe or deadened skin?
spiraling further in
spiraling further in


burn a candle to my skin
turn the handle, let me in
i cannot be your guardian anymore
burn a candle to my skin
turn the handle, let me in
i cannot be your medicine anymore, anymore


i am a moment in time
when your eyes start to wander
and your head starts to spin
from the simplest task
deciding what you will wear
finding faults in a straight line
i have to remember to stop
wringing out the same cloth


burn a candle to my skin
turn the handle, let me in
i cannot be your guardian anymore
burn a candle to my skin
turn the handle, let me in
