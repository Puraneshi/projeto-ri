I'm Goin In|Drake|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yeah
uh-huh
um, uh-huh
okay


hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
it's weezy f baby, come to take a shit and urine
on these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
i'm so official, all i need is a whistle
bitch named crystal, let her suck my pistol
she open up her mouth and then i blow her brains out
you ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
the feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'


i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
bitch i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard


first off, you know what it is if you heard drake
making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
never see me out 'cause i live in my workplace
i'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
look at where i landed, you would think i planned it
i'm just doing me and you could never understand it
chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
blowin' purple clouds, nigga i'm so sky high
i ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
out of this world though, i'm so sci-fi
and i don't sit still, i keep it moving like a drive-by
i just tell the truth and so i'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and i ain't ever met a good cop
me and wayne lean like kareem doin' hook shots
cover me, i'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop


i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
bitch i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard


it goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
it's the el capitan, i got motherfuckin' lieutenants
and if i said ""i'm goin' in"" then i motherfuckin' meant it
and if i brought it in the club then i'ma motherfuckin' spend it
cost a few hundred bands and i'm motherfuckin' in it
no need for a room, yeah you know i'm fuckin' in it
she actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' winnin'
she said ""i seen it all"", i say ""no you fuckin' didn't""
you ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
she said ""i can't feel my legs"", i'm like ""bitch, me neither""
i'm goin' in, where should i begin?
i don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
and i'ma be a legend even when my life end
and i'ma be a legend even when this night ends
yeah i do my thang, hop up out it like bem!
bitch, i said i'm him, so i'm nothin' like them


i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
bitch i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
i'm goin' in, i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard, and i'ma go hard"
ULT|Denzel Curry|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
this is the wrath of aquarius
i am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
humanitarian, bitch i'm a veteran
better than anyone comprehend
snake in the grass, cut the copperhead
hollow-tips point at a copper' head
drop a head, popping the glock till the copper dead
but bishop killed radames
that is the biggest hypocrisy
i don't see nobody stopping me
boy, your whole life is a mockery
a militant mind of the million
civilian, i am the realest, bitch
no gilligan put me on an island
smoking on an island 'til a nigga look thailand
spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
federation in your area
if i'm a bitch then i guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier (woof)
run all your paper, killer curry keep on catching the caper
dominating common denominator
aftermath you can just do the math later, as a teenager
i was an underdog under the raiders, valuable player
young bo jackson slammin' packs with a passion
satisfaction with the lack of compassion
it's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
i am that nigga entirely
the same ones that inspire me be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga


in the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
when i'm ghost, i'mma cut the line, now you outta mind
y'all niggas ain't u.l.t. (ultimate)
y'all niggas ain't u.l.t. (ultimate)

mystical miracle, i build imperial
i'm analytical, why lotto had to be off to the clinical
now we're identical, black individual, no biochemical
serve, fuck the cops they the opposition
and these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
wanna be buddy-buddy they see you at a show
but be the main ones that be hating on the low
wait, that's just irrelevant, they got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other
don't know, where the fuck they came from
we the ones that paid dues
i don't watch fox news, don't mean that all my foxes sly
find a little white girl, but let you die
gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist
better get caught with it than without it if i keep it concealed when i carry it, i
put them on paper, send them to prison and give them free labor
separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
fuck all my haters
i raise up black fists as black as the raiders
arming the gators
federation is my organization
all relation, no religion, no races
black to asian we the nation of u.l.t
true to you so keep it true to me
haters cannot put an end to me because i truly know who is my enemy, nigga


in the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
when i'm ghost, i'mma cut the line, now you outta mind
y'all niggas ain't u.l.t. (ultimate)
y'all niggas ain't u.l.t. (ultimate)

Ten Crack Commandments|The Notorious B.I.G.|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9


it's the ten crack commandments, what?
nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
niggas on the corner i ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas


i've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
there's rules to this shit, i wrote me a manual
a step-by-step booklet for you to get
your game on track, not your wig pushed back
rule nombre uno: never let no one know
how much dough you hold cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
if that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
number 2: never let 'em know your next move
don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
take it from your highness
i done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
number 3: never trust nobody
your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
she be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
number 4: i know you heard this before
""never get high on your own supply""
number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
i don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em ""bounce!""
number 6: that goddamn credit? forget it
you think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely separated
money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit
number 8: never keep no weight on you!
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
number 9 shoulda been number 1 to me:
if you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
if niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna to listen
they be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
number 10: a strong word called ""consignment""
strictly for live men, not for freshmen
if you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""
cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
if not, 24 years on the wake up
slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
your girl fucked my man jake up
heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half a cake up
heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

Once an Addict|J. Cole|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
right, right, right, right
something's got a hold on me
right, right, right, right
sometimes i think pain is just a lack of understanding
if we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
god must feel no pain
something's got a hold on me
only joy
does this mean even our suffering pleases him?


lost in a cloud of marijuana
young carolina nigga, fish out of water
step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
mama ain't recover yet
callin' me at 12 at night
she drunk as fuck and i'm upset
'cause why she always using me for crutch?
growin' up i used to always see her up
late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from marvin gaye
she kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
i gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when i see her like this
too young to deal with pain
i'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
so 'ville became my escape from a feelin' i hate
mama cursing me out
depression's such a villainous state
i used to stay out later on purpose
subconsciously i was nervous that if i came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
and then i'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
tears flow while al green blow
love and happiness
i wish that i could say the right words to cheer her up
i wish her son's love was enough
i tell her, ""mama, go to sleep""
she tell me ""boy, hush. you better pray to god you never get your heart crushed""
i shake my head in frustration
head to my room and i can still hear the tunes with my door shut
fuck it though, a couple more months i'll be gone
off to college and dorms
foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
but now it's 1 am and my mama dialin' my phone
i know she intoxicated and soon this high that i'm on comes crashin' down
she lit, talkin' drunk shit, i'm pissed
but i'm still all ears like basset hounds
thinkin' to myself, ""maybe my mama need help
don't she got work in the morning?
why she do this to herself?
hate how she slurrin' her words
soundin' so fuckin' absurd
this ain't the woman i know, why i just sit and observe?
why don't i say how i feel?
when i do, she's defensive for real
well maybe things get better with time, i heard it heals
little did i know how deep her sadness would go
lookin' back, i wish i woulda did more instead of runnin'


something's got a hold on me
i can't let it go
out of fear i won't be free
something's got a hold on me
i can't let it go
out of fear i won't be—
no!
something's got a hold on me
i can't let it go
right
life can bring much pain
there are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
choose wisely (right)"

just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
the old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey


ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
you walk by, they get wrong
you reply, then shit get blown
way outta proportion, way past discussion
just you against them, pick one, then rush him
figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
they don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
to the hospital with a bad concussion
plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
you could fuck around, get shot, die any day
niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
usually niggas don't know what to do when
their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
for red or for blue or for blow, i guess
from bankhead up to yo projects


no more stress, now i'm straight
now i get it, now i take
time to think before i make
mistakes just for my family's sake
that part of me left yesterday
the heart of me is strong today
no regrets, i'm blessed to say
the old me dead and gone away


ohh, i've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
the old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
and ohh, i've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
the old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey


i ain't never been scared, i lived through tragic
situation coulda been dead lookin' back at it
most of that shit didn't even have to happen
but you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
in apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
get locked up, then didn't even get mad
now think about, damn, what a life i had!
most of that shit, look back, just laugh
some shit, still look back, get sad
maybe my homeboy still be around
had i not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
i won that fight, i lost that war
i can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
who'da thought i'd never see philant no more?
got enough dead homies, i don't want no more
cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
i'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
now think before i risk my life
take them chances to get my stripe
a nigga put his hands on me, alright
otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘cause i hit you, you sue me
i shoot you, get locked up, who? me?


no more stress, now i'm straight
now i get it, now i take
time to think before i make
mistakes just for my family's sake
that part of me left yesterday
the heart of me is strong today
no regrets, i'm blessed to say

ohh, i've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)

and ohh, i've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
the old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey


i turn my head to the east
i don't see nobody by my side
i turn my head to the west
still nobody in sight
so i turn my head to the north
swallow that pill that they call pride
the old me is dead and gone
but the new me will be alright


ohh, i've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
the old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
and ohh, i've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)

coming from afar (coming from afar)
reaching for the stars (reaching from the stars)
run away with me to another place
we can rely on each other, uh-huh (yeah)
from one corner to another, uh-huh


yeah
yo
yo
some got hopes and dreams
we got ways and means
the supreme dream team always up with the schemes
from hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
my rise to the top floating on this cream
who the hell wanna stop me, i hated those who doubt me
a million refugees with unlimited warranties
black caesar, dating top divas
diplomatic legalese; no time for a visa
they just begun, i'mma shoot them one-by-one
got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
strike with the forces of king solomon
letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
i'mma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
keeping it retrospective from the get go
lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
p-p-politic with ghetto senators on the d-low


ghetto supastar
that is what you are
coming from afar
reaching for the stars
run away with me to another place
we can rely on each other, uh-huh
from one corner to another, uh-huh


one, two
and you don't stop
yo!
my eyes is sore, being a senator
behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
the rich go north, ignore the tug of war
while the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
so i became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
i'ma reveal everything, change the law
i find myself walking the streets
trying to find what's really going on in the streets


now every dog got his day, needless to say
when the chief away that's when them cats want to play
i told you, mess around you fools like cassius clay
stretch my heater make you do a pot of beret
kick your balls like pele, pick em doing ballet
peak like dante, broader than broadway
get applause like a matador, cry yelling ""ole!""
who the hell wanna save me, from b.k. to cali


ghetto supastar
that is what you are
coming from afar
reaching for the stars
run away with me to another place
we can rely on each other, uh-huh
from one corner to another, uh-huh


yeah... yo, yeah
just when you thought it was safe in a common place
showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
2-faced, getting defaced, out like scarface
throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface


well i'm paranoid at the things i say
wondering what's the penalty from day to day, i'm hanging out
partying with girls that never die, you see i was
picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
was the one holding the gun and the glove
but it's all good as long as it's understood
it's all together now in the hood


ghetto supastar
that is what you are
coming from afar
reaching for the stars
run away with me to another place
we can rely on each other, uh-huh (uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh)
from one corner to another, uh-huh (yeah)
(all-stars)
ghetto supastar
that is what you are
coming from afar
reaching for the stars
run away with me (sing it baby) to another place (sing it baby)
we can rely on each other, uh-huh
from one corner to another, uh-huh

Patiently Waiting|50 Cent|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
hey em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
i owe you for this one


i been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
you can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
if it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
if you thinkin' i'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong


i'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
destination heaven
sit and politic with passengers from 9/11
the lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
shit, i ain't even got to try to shine
god's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
i got scriptures in my brain, i could spit at your dame
straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like conan
picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines
knowin' the source will quote it
when i die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
i grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
i caught cases, i copped out, does that make me a quitter?
in this white man's world i'm similar to a squirrel
lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
if i get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again
these industry niggas ain't friends
they know how to pretend


i been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
you can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
if it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
if you thinkin' i'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
i been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
you can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
if it feels like my flow's been hot for so long

if you're patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
as you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
it's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above


they think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
let's face it, shit, basically
they're just playin' sick, they ain't shit
they ain't sayin' shit — spray 'em, 50!
a to the k, get in the way i'll bring dre and them with me
and turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
don't let me lose you, i'm not tryna confuse you
when i let loose with this uzi
and just shoot through your isuzu
you get the message? am i gettin' through to you?
you know what's comin'?
you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
take some big and some pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
sprinkle a little big l on top, what the fuck do you got?
you got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
the juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
it's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
you put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
shit, what you know about death threats, ‘cause i get a lot
shady records was eighty seconds away from the towers
some cowards fucked with the wrong building
they meant to hit ours
better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
there's nothin' spookier
you now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50


i been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
you can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
if it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
if you thinkin' i'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
if the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
it's 50, they say it's 50
see a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
it's 50 — man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name


niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
and if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
‘cause i'll break your face
have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
you goin' against me, dawg, you makin' a mistake, i'll split ya
leave you lookin' like the michael jackson jackets
with all them zippers
i'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
the way i turn the money over, you should call me flipper
your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
i fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
i'm down to sell records but not my soul
snoop said this in '94: ""we don't love them hoes.""
i got pennies for my thoughts, now i'm rich
see the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six
niggas wearin' flags ‘cause the colors match they clothes
they get caught in the wrong hood
and filled up with holes, motherfucker


i been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
you can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
if it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
if you thinkin' i'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

Triumph (feat. Cappadonna)|Wu-Tang Clan|hip-hop-rap-trap|" / 


what? y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
i'm the osiris of this shit
wu-tang is here forever, motherfuckers
this like, this '97
aight my niggas and my niggarettes
let's do it like this
i'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
let's take it back to '79


i bomb atomically, socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
can't define how i be dropping these mockeries
lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
ultraviolet shine blind forensics
i inspect you through the future see millennium
killa beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets, queen beez ease the guns in
rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow, swinging swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


as the world turns, i spread like germ
bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
this my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan
into the fire, transform into the ghost rider
a six-pack and a streetcar named desire
who got my back
in the line of fire holding back?
what? my peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
it's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
what the blood clot? we smoke pot
and blow spots, you want to think twice? i think not
the iron lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
guns of navarone tearing up your battle zone
rip through your slums


i twist darts from the heart, tried and true
loop my voice on the lp
martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
vocabulary 'donna talking, tell your story walking
take cover kid, what? run for your brother, kid
run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
my deadly notes reign supreme, your thought is basic compared to mine
domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
take a free ride on my thought
i got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to god


the saga continues
wu-tang, wu-tang


olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
we crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
judgment day cometh, conquer, it's war
allow us to escape hell, globe spinning bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tunes spit the shitty mortal kombat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
a death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
my orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
my music sicily, rich california smell
an axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing-sing, sipping on ginseng
righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


march of the wooden soldiers, c-cypher-punks couldn't hold us
a thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like flair
escape from your dragon's lair
in particular my beats travel like a vortex
through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
heart terminal like grand central station
program fat basslines on novation
getting drunk like i'm fucking ducking five-year probation


war of the masses, the outcome disastrous
many of the victim families save their ashes
a million names on walls, engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for the acts
another heart is torn as close ones mourn
those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
came one to represent the nation
this is a gathering of the masses
that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
the high chief jamel irief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save self from
this relentless attack of the track spares none


yo yo yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
lamping like them gray and black puma's on my man's rack
codeine was forced in your drink
you had a navy green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
you two-faces, scum of the slum, i got your whole body numb
blowing like shalamar in '81
sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
hands like sonny liston, get fly permission
hold the fuck up, i'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
i humiliate, separate the english from the dutch
it's me, black noble drew ali, came in threes
we like the genovese, sazon season these degrees
it's earth, 93 million miles from the first
rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
connect thoughts to make my man child walk
swift notarizer, blue-tang, all up in the high-riser
new york yank visor, word tranquilizer
adjust the dosage, delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
tear down the beat god then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor, lex, the white gold tarantula
track truck diesel, play the weed god substantiala
max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
guaranteed made 'em jump like rod strickland"

no green grass, no porch
i just want sea shores
all my life
all my life pretty women done told me lies
all my life pretty women done told me lies
all my life pretty women done told me lies
told me lies, told me lies

eyes can't hide your hate for me
maybe you was made for the maybelline
spent so much tryna park the car
barely got a tip for the maître d'
you head straight to the oyster bar
i tread light each time we speak
play too rough might break ya heart
and them glass shoes ain't made to walk
these lonely streets
unpaved, unscathed
morning dew's giving you the coldest feet
said that you was comin' through after dark
to look at the stars and hardly speak
this thing called love real hard for me
this thing called love is a god to me
and we all just god's property
so feel free to fulfill the prophecy


adam, eve
apple trees
watch out for the snakes baby
open streets
ocean breeze
we should get away, baby

High For Hours|J. Cole|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
this is called being high as shit, for hours
that's the name of this song, nigga
""high as shit for hours""
here we go, yeah


american hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
they came here seekin' freedom
then they end up ownin' slaves
justified it usin' christianity which saves
religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
that's why isis is a crisis
but in reality this country do the same shit
take a life and call it righteous
remember when bin laden got killed, supposedly?
in a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
these white ladies watchin' cnn, coverin' the action
they read the headline and then they all started clappin'
as if lebron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
i stood there for a second
watched them high-five each other
for real? i thought this was ""thou shalt not kill""
but police still lettin' off on niggas in the ville
claimin' that he reached for a gun
they really think we dumb and got a death wish
now somebody's son is layin' breathless
when i was a little boy my father lived in texas
pulled up in toyota, drove that bitch like it was lexus
put my bag in his trunk and headed off for dallas
out there for the summer, feelin' just like i was alice
lost in the wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
just like they was back home, and that's wrong
so now it's ""fuck the government!""
they see my niggas strugglin'
and they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah


the type of shit that make you wanna
the type of shit that make you wanna let go
the type of shit that make you wanna
the type of shit that make you wanna let go


i had a convo with the president, i paid to go and see him
thinkin' about the things i said i'd say when i would see him
feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
thinkin' about the black man plight, think i might choke
nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
and if so, if you got all the power in the clout
as the president, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
well, i didn't say ""nigga,"" but you catch my drift
he looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
he broke the issues down
and showed me he was well-aware
i got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
but dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up?
he said, ""there's things that i wanna fix
but you know this shit, nigga: politics.""
don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
you can make the world better
for your kids before you leave it
change is slow, always has been, always will be
but fuck that, i'ma bust back 'til they kill me
change is slow, always has been, always will be
but fuck that, i'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?

here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
see, the people at the top
they get to do just what they want
'til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
then they start to holla ""revolution!""
tired of livin' here, destitution
fuck that lootin'! can you tell me what's the best solution?
i used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
if we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
but see, it's not that simple
i got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
while this instrumental played
then i realized somethin' that made
me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
before you trip and throw a fit over these words i say
think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
the children in abusive households grow up
knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
so understand
you get the power, but you know what power does to man?
corruption always leads us to the same shit again
so when you talk 'bout revolution
dawg, i hear just what you sayin'
what good is takin' over
when we know what you gon' do?
the only real revolution happens right inside of you
i said, what good is takin' over
when we know what you gon' do?
the only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear


my life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
i'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
i feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
and i'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
and i'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
but fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
or comfortable and roomy in a 6
but they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
and yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball, but i'm too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away


that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear


there's people that love me and people that hate me (yup)
but it's the evil that made me
this backstabbin', deceitful and shady (mhm)
i want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
that means i end up burnin' in hell, scorchin' in flame
that means i'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
this lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'cause right now, i feel like i've just hit the rock bottom
i've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (duh)
i'm screamin' like them two cops when 2pac shot 'em
holdin' two glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
my daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
and them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
and while you flaunt 'em
i could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
i got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'cause i ain't never went gold off one song
i'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn


that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
that's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
that's rock bottom"

Don't Sweat The Technique|Eric B. & Rakim|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
don't sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique


let's trace the hits and check the file
let see who bit to detect the style
i flip the script so they can't get foul
at least not now, it'll take a while
i change the pace to complete the beat
i drop the bass to mc's get weak
for every word they trace it's a scar they keep
cause when i speak, they freak to sweat the technique
i made my debut in '86
with a melody and a president's mix
and now i stay on target and refuse to miss
and i still make hits with beats
parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
my underground sound vibrates the streets
mc's wanna beef then i play for keeps
when they sweat the technique


don't sweat the technique


they wanna know how many rhymes have i ripped and wrecked
but researchers never found all the pieces yet
scientists try to solve the context
philosophers are wondering what's next
pieces are took to labs to observe them
they couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
my ideas are only for the audience's ears
for my opponents, it might take years
pencils and pens are swords
letters put together from a key to chords
i'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
because of my culture, i'm equipped to construct the
technical styles that'll be full of technology
complete sights and new heights after i get deep
you don't have to speak just seek
and peep the technique


never sweat the technique


i speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
then i get deep in the beat then complete the
poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
they never grow old, techniques become antiques
better then something brand new cause it's real
and in a while the style’ll have much more value
classical, too intelligent to be radical
masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
you fought and sought, the thoughts and ideas
it's cool when you freak to the beat
but don't sweat the technique


never sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique
don't sweat the technique"

to west, y’all (west y’all), sound pound straight through your
bubble vest, y’all (vest, y’all), and check your chest, y’all (chest, y’all)


ay caramba.  starang, gunn clappa numba

still play the back in my thunder gear down to
my underwear, make all y’all motherfuckers wonder where
i come from, ‘cause motherfuck dapper dan
i’m a gunn clappa, fam, plus i’ll run rappers, man
fab 5 mad live, blow up the spot
dru ha gets the paper, black moon still “gets da props”


ayyo
next to snap a neck be big r-o-c-k
send emcees to me in squads of three, say
“rockness monsta, is he for real?  it can’t be”
see him in action as he transform, that man’s me
enemies ain’t kotter—ain’t no welcome back in my home-ah
knots get blown like quarter slots in payphones-ah
phone home or return like jedi
i bet i can, without la, give your stupid ass the red eye


me nah
like niggas who can’t see pass a likkle bit
of light.  you come test the champions, ya gon’ die
tonight, and six-feet deep is where you sleep
eternally resting in peace, you felt relief
now big-up to all my true heads in the east
stalking the block, not leaving their house without their gat
you’re best to believe that fab 5 got my back
(got my back) like that (like that)


i control
the masses with metaphors that’s massive
don’t ask if the nigga ruck’ll bash shit like cassius
i’m drastic.  when it comes to verbs, i be flipping
‘cause herbs just be shitting off the words i be kicking
i scold you, double-headed sword for the petty
but i told you bitch niggas that heads ain’t ready
now i’ll mold you back to the bitch that you are
fucking with the ruckus, get bruised, battered, and scarred


guess who?
punk, chump, your brain just blew
it’s the originoo gunn clappa two
rushing through.  three-on-three, you can’t see we
‘cause we stay tight and not too many niggas wanna fight
some sneaker-wearing nigga in the cypher of the camp
just got amped, and so i took him out for a dance
bigger triggers falling down
like the bridges of london, but ain’t too many niggas running

drama than what? (a primetime nbc tv show)

heads don’t know and damn sure ain’t ready
niggas walk the streets with more boop than betty
(shit’ll get heavy) back up, retreat, now surrender
my pine hits your mind, mix thoughts just like a blender

then i dish off from a shooting guard to a center
like rockefeller, you hit rock-bottom when you enter

o.g.c. rush the scene.  “permission for backup”
baseball bats attack like jersey fools that act up
punks and fags stand petro.  go get
yo’ pepto-bismol before this nigga let go

get set
go, which you do.  corkscrewed, i blew through
two crews who claim they got funk—may be true ‘cause they doo-doo


everybody
‘fraid, ain’t nobody yapping no more
have evidence on your clique, so y’all niggas hit the floor.  with that
mouth-murdering, you got that ass in hot water
now i just oughta send a piece to your headquarters
to take away your stripes.  you fucked up tonight
you don’t do right, you’re gwan get dead despite
our clik foundation stays thick through the war
i’m keeping my eye out for infiltrators at the door



it’s a shame how these emcees are wannabees
front on these and get hung up like dungarees (please)
ease off, selector.  strangle
wrecks ya, plus bust asses on whoever passes through my sector

so what you gonna do when you’re stuck at thirty-two
degrees?  please get off your knees and follow these
now swallow these buckshots from the rifle
then i will make niggas “beat it” and “scream” like michael

so how many corny emcees gwan try

i smother a nigga, then the ruck bounce like rubber

step to the stage, set the microphone on fire

How To Love|Lil Wayne|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
cut the music up
a little louder


you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
how to love, how to love
you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in a corner trying put it together
how to love, how to love
for a second you were here, now you over there
it's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
like you never had a love, never had a love


when you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
but now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
but you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
without you being insecure
you never credit yourself, so when you got older
it seems like you came back ten times over
now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (ayy)
feelin' like i'm headed for the padded cell, the
bar for me when i rap isn't fair but
guess that's the standard i'm held to
but if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
you set a mark too high when platinum sales are
looked at as a failure (yeah)
then you better take it back to the shelter and hamburger helper

Express Yourself|N.W.A.|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
dr. dre: yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
ice cube: man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
dr. dre: so what you want me to do? ... (express yourself)


i'm expressing with my full capabilities
and now i'm living in correctional facilities
cause some don't agree with how i do this
i get straight, meditate like a buddhist
i'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube, because he says it gets funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
some suckers just tickle me pink
to my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
you know what? i won't hesitate to dis one
or two before i'm through, so don't try to sing this
some drop science, well i'm dropping english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express, yo i don't smoke weed or sess
cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
but making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel


express yourself
come on and do it


now, getting back to the pg
that's program, and it's easy
dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
the words, the style, the trend, the records i spin
again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
there's no fessing and guessing while i'm expressing myself
it's crazy to see people be
what society wants them to be, but not me
ruthless is the way to go, they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hip-hop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
some musicians cuss at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go looking for the dopeman
or they ban my group from the radio, hear n.w.a and say ""hell no!""
but you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...


express yourself
come on and do it


from the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
then expression is a big part of it
you ain't efficient when you flow
you ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
there's a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
or a lesson, all of 'em expression
and if you start fessing, i got a smith and wesson for you
i might ignore your record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
it's dre on the mic, getting physical
doing the job, n.w.a is the lynch mob
yes, i'm macabre but you know you need this
and the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
or a tumor but here's the rumor
dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
when i start expressing myself, yella slam it
cause if i stay funky like this, i'm doing damage

i would prefer the aces, ain't no different when you taste it
a 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
i'm early to the party, but my 'rari is the latest
somehow it seems girls in they late teens
remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
life's a mothafucka, ain't it? these other rappers ain't us
so tell me what your name is, i'ma tell it to my stainless
you aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
it's just me, myself, and i and mothafuckas that i came with
miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me

cause my chain came from cuba, got a lock up on the link
and them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
what you mean? tell me what you drink, i'm on that kissin' pink
you could call me billy gates, got a crib in every state
man on the moon, got a condo out in space
open up your legs, tell me how it taste
and them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “tell it to my face”
tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
in a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits

i got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
when the world gives you a raw deal
sets you off 'til you scream, ""piss off! screw you!""
when it talks to you like you don't belong
or tells you you're in the wrong field
when something's in your mitochondrial
'cause it latched on to you, like—


knock knock, let the devil in
manevolent as i've ever been, head is spinnin'
this medicine's screamin', ""l-l-l-let us in!""
l-l-l-like a salad bowl, edgar allan poe
bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
liquid tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
wicked, i get all high when i think i've smelled the scent
of elephant manure—hell, i meant kahlúa
screw it, to hell with it, i went through hell with accelerants
and blew up my-my-myself again
volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
mayo and went from hellmann's and being rail thin
filet-o-fish, scribble jam, rap olympics '97 freaknik
how can i be down? me and bizarre in florida
proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
dr. dre said, ""hell yeah!""
and i got his stamp like a postcard, word to mel-man
and i know they're gonna hate
but i don't care, i barely can wait
to hit 'em with the snare and the bass
square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
because they're gonna taste my—


venom, (i got that) adrenaline momentum
and i'm not knowin' when i'm
ever gonna slow up and i'm
ready to snap any moment i'm

i said knock knock, let the devil in
shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
it-it's evident i'm not done
v-venomous, the thoughts spun
like a web and you just caught in 'em
held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
beat strangler attack
so this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
like, what's her name's at the wheel? danica patrick
threw the car into reverse at the indy, a nut crashin'
into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
my mustang and the jeep wrangler grill
with the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and gandhi (gandhi)

with the ballpoint pen i'm

fired up and caught fire, juggernaut

'cause the doc put me on like sunblock
why the fuck not, you only get one shot
ate shit 'til i can't taste it
chased it with straight liquor
then paint thinner, then drank 'til i faint
and awake with a headache
and i take anything in rectangular shape
then i wait to face the demons i'm bonded to
'cause they're chasin' me but i'm part of you
so escapin' me is impossible
i latch onto you like a—parasite
and i probably ruined your parents' life
and your childhood too
'cause if i'm the music that y'all grew up on
i'm responsible for you retarded fools
i'm the super villain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
you marvel that? eddie brock is you

he did the job, money came with ease
blowing outta town, moving bricks and ki's
him and his bitch, in forty-g rides
holding down fort like they bonnie n clyde
luxury cars of all makes and models
new outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle
glass in the air (air), toast to my team (team)
toast to my cream and the scotties that beam
my niggas fiend, i'm abouts da beamer

got work release after doing a 3-to-life bid
cause of drug logic
shouldn't touch it
now out to budget
with a movie star chick from outta edenwald projects
nice job, took prison camp drives
while he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle
the sweat off the brow was soon on garment
both worked
got themselves a two-bedroom apartment
great statement, without delayment, away and went
saved to get a house on one of them low down payments
but an idea concocted his stock
why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip
so he gave his man a shriek and excitement
didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment
sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck
sent him back up north to do a super long stretch again

a lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under, their noses
i hate those motherfucking posers
but i'm so real, to them it's scary
and with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
and no, we don't make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back
when i'm kicking real facts
i represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
you're paranoid cause you're a son like elroy
and you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal


""money's growing like grass with the mass appeal""


oh yes, i'm greater than all mc's when i breeze
give me room, please
i be like fascinating when i be updating
cutting off wack kids, pulling their trump cards
i thump hard, and make 'em say that i'm god
niggas be pretending they're hardcore
never know the meaning of (raw)
but i get props like a slogan
and no man could ever try to diss when i kicks my jam
lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
no double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
but if i have to, i go all out with no mic
yeah, that's right, cause i survived mad fights
and for my peeps i truly care
cause without some of them i wouldn't be here
and they all know how i feel
cause suckers be like playing themselves to have mass appeal


""money's growing like grass with the mass appeal""


i know i'm dope, but don't wet that
i've suffered setbacks, but now i'm making greenbacks
just like baggy slacks, i'm crazy hip-hop
check one two and you don't stop
your head'll bop when i drop my crop of pure bomb
just like the seashore i'm calm
but wild, with my monotone style
because i don't need gimmicks
give me a fly beat and i'm all in it
word is bond, i go on and on
for you it's tragic, i got magic like wands
so i'ma end this lecture and i bet ya
those who kick dirt, in due time i'm gonna get ya
cause i be kicking the real
while they be losing the race trying to chase mass appeal


""money's growing like grass with the mass appeal"""
Real Friends|Kanye West|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
real friends, how many of us?
how many of us, how many jealous? real friends
it's not many of us, we smile at each other
but how many honest? trust issues
switched up the number, i can't be bothered
i cannot blame you for havin' an angle
i ain't got no issues, i'm just doin' my thing
hope you're doin' your thing, too
i'm a deadbeat cousin, i hate family reunions
fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
in town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
who your real friends? we all came from the bottom
i'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
damn i forgot to call her, shit i thought it was thursday
why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
when was the last time i remembered a birthday?
when was the last time i wasn't in a hurry?


tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
even to call your daughter on her facetime
even when we was young i used to make time
now we be way too busy just to make time
even for my...


real friends
i guess i get what i deserve, don't i?
word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
i guess i get what i deserve, don't i?
talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him


i couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (was)
couldn't tell you how old your son is (is)
i got my own jr. on the way, dawg (dawg)
plus i already got one kid (kid)
couldn't tell you much about the fam though
i just showed up for the yams though
maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
merry christmas, then i'm finished, then it's back to business
you wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (shit)
like i ain't got enough pressure to deal with (with)
please don't pressure me with that bill shit (shit)
cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
niggas thinkin' i'm crazy, you defendin' me
it's funny i ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
to be honest, dawg, i ain't feelin' your energy
money turn your kin into an enemy
niggas ain't real as they pretend to be


lookin' for all my real friends
how many of us? how many of us are real friends
to real friends, 'til the reel end
'til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
to 3 a.m., callin'
how many real friends?
just to ask you a question
just to see how you was feelin'
how many?
for the last you was frontin'
i hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam? hope you good""
you say, ""i'm good, i'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
how many?
what's best for your family, immediate or extended
any argument, the media'll extend it
i had a cousin that stole my laptop that i was fuckin' bitches on
paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
real friends
huh?

gettin' paper every day, it's all i'm trippin' on
'cause ain't nothin' like a rag in californ-i-a

and mashi'n to the backyard boogie

so i bails in the party, everythang is cool
it's niggas in the hood i ain't seen since high school
and everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
crips, damus, and other clicks and crews
just gettin' they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin' loose

i'm even kickin' back, and i'm usually chicken hawkin
the bloods shootin' dice, and the crips are c-walkin

Give Up the Goods (Just Step) (feat. Big Noyd)|Mobb Deep|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
ayo, queens get the money, long time no cash
i'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
the fool retaliated so i had to think fast
pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
now who the fuck you think is living to this day?
i'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
they looked at me and said, ""queens niggas don't play
do your thing, i'll do mine kid stay outta my way""
it's type hard tryna survive in new york state
but can't stop till i'm eating off a platinum plate
po-po comes around and tries to relocate me
lock me up forever but they can't deflate me
'cause having cash is highly addictive
especially when you're used to having money to live with
i thought, step back, look at my life as a whole
ain't no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul
i'm out for delfia, selfia, p's not helping ya
i'm tryna get this lexus up, plus a cellular
yo, big noyd! (what up, cousin?) i can't cope
with all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope


yo, it's the r-a-double-p-e-r
n-o-y-d, niggas can't fuck with me
coming straight outta qb, pushing an infiniti
you ask can i rip it constantly? mentally?
definitely, to the death of me, come and test me
trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me
so bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause i'ma blast you
my lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
i'm born with it, i'm getting on with it
and i'ma have it 'ill i'm fucking dead and gone with it
'cause i'm a what? composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
don't make me buck ya, 'cause i'm a wild muthafucka
you know my flow, you know my steelo
even pack my gat when i go to see my po
jump out my hooptie, pass my gat and my lucci
to my shorty in case my po try to troop me
to the island, and if i start wildin'
flipping on niggas walking around with the nice gold medallions
but she didn't violate me, so i escaped, see
back to queens, pumping the fiends, making more cream
know what i mean? i'm a natural born hustler
won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4-4 and bust ya


yo, ain't no time for faking jacks
'cause brothers that fake jacks get laid on their backs
the streets is real, can't roll without steel
i feel how i feel 'cause i was born to kill
do what i gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starving
don't try to find a job, son, it's all about robbing
so don't be alarmed when we come through
we supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown, dude
off the map, 'cause i react, attack
a brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so i act like that
drug dealing, only mess with shorties that's appealin'
i'm frontin' on the world once i start 4-wheeling
'cause back on the 41st side, we do it right
sipping e&j, getting bent all night
yo, who that? i never seen him in my whole life
step to his business 'cause it's only right
po-po ain't around so i grab my pound
money retaliated so i hit the ground
my life is on the line, gotta hold my projects down
can't see myself getting bodied by a clown
ass nigga that ain't even from my town
hit him up in the chest, now he's laying man down
jetted up from under the benches, i started hearing sirens
i stop firing, to cut ass like a diamond
jetted to the crib piece, what a relief
stashed the heat then proceeded to peep
out the window, call my son
""yo son, we got beef, but no question
money had a problem so i solved him""


i got my mind on a stick-up, now it's time to get paid
thinking of ways to take loot already made
there's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
give me yours or get laid
give up the goods or get sprayed


i got lots of love for my crew that is
no love for them other crews and rival kids
all them out-of-town niggas know what time it is
and if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up
caught up in the crossfire get theyself hurt up
while i be sipping gin straight in a plastic cup
on a park bench on 12th street, my whole crew's famous
you tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless
first of all, slow down, you on the wrong route
let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about

i'm facing the bottle
(i'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but i'm coping)
for all of my problems (i'm too open)
these instagram models (glad i left her)
are nothing but trouble (but i don't know her lord)
she's going away now (now it's over)
i'm going full throttle (you drive me crazy)
all these instagram models
i said they're nothing but trouble"
Window Pain|J. Cole|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
one night
when me and my mom was about to go to bed
all the doors was locked
then when i had fell asleep
my mom had heard three gun shots
it was to my cousin, his name was rod
the one that came to pick me up
he had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
and he got shot right in the stomach


i put my hand to the sky, i sing
grateful for the blessings you bring
thank you for the ones i love
forgive me for the times i was
down and confused, i know
what i reap is what i will sow
once again i find myself
back with you from my hell
all i ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
get some money plus respect and now look, i got all of that
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
all i wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
all i wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry


right now i'm starin' out the window of my range and contemplating, am i sane?
have i sacrificed for fame?
my occupation's on my brain
thought that i could change it all if i had change
but the niggas that i came up with way back is still the same
i be tryna give 'em game like santa did when christmas came
they be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
it go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
niggas bang in the ville, i always thought that shit was strange
how you claim blood or cuz when that was just a la thing?
i don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, i'm just sayin'
that it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck
he don't give a fuck, he's on henny and xanny'd up
blowin' tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
he gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
the results are deadly
because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
the little girl i met this past summer said, ""don't forget me""
i won't forget you, how could i with all you went through?
a bullet hit yo' cousin in temple while he was with you
and while you was talkin', i was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
if you was my sister then i would kiss you and tell you that i'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
i know i'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything i done been through


i put my hand to the sky, i sing
grateful for the blessings you bring
thank you for the ones i love
forgive me for the times i was
down and confused, i know
what i reap is what i will sow
once again i find myself
back with you from my hell
all i ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
get some money plus respect and now look, i got all of that
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
all i wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
all i wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry


it's not that big
well at least, um
god had saved him 'cause he still alive
so why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
like why can't the world just be all nice things?
because god is tryna, um
warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
or he's tryna warn us of he's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
he's comin' back to, um, have us be his children and for us to see him for the first time so we can rejoice with him and have our time
and after we do that, he's gonna restart the world
k.o.d
choose wisely!"

man, i promise, she's so self-conscious
she has no idea what she doin' in college
that major that she majored in don't make no money
but she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
now, tell me that ain't insecurr
the concept of school seems so securr
sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
she like, ""fuck it, i'll just stay down hurr and do hair.""
‘cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
of new airs, ‘cause her baby daddy don't really care
she's so precious with the peer pressure
couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off, now she look like eve
and she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
single black female addicted to retailers, and well


oh, when it all, it all falls down
and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
i'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
c'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
oh, when it all


man, i promise, i'm so self-conscious
that's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollie's and pasha's done drove me crazy
i can't even pronounce nothin', pass that ver-say-see!
then i spent four hundred bucks on this
just to be like, ""nigga, you ain't up on this.""
and i can't even go to the grocery store
without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
it seem we livin' the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
we tryna buy back our 40 acres
and for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
even if you in a benz, you still a nigga in a coupe


oh, when it all, it all falls down
come on, come on
i'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
oh, when it all, it all falls down
come on, come on
i'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
and when it all falls down


i say, ""fuck the police,"" that's how i treat 'em
we buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
we'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
things we buy to cover up what's inside
'cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
that's why shorty's hollerin', ""where the ballers at?""
drug dealer buy jordan, crackhead buy crack
and the white man get paid off of all of that
but i ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'cause fuck it, i went to jacob with 25 thou
before i had a house and i'd do it again
‘cause i wanna be on 106 & park, pushin' a benz
i want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
i got a couple past-due bills, i won't get specific
i got a problem with spendin' before i get it
we all self-conscious, i'm just the first to admit it


oh, when it all, it all falls down
c'mon, c'mon

i'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Shook Ones, Pt. II|Mobb Deep|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
to all the killers and a hundred dollar billas
for real dealers who ain't got no feelings
check it out now

i got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
you heard of us
official white folks murderers
my mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware
of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
for all of those who wanna profile and pose
rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nosebone
you all alone in these streets, cousin
every man for their self in this land we be gunnin'
and keep them shook crews runnin'
like they supposed to
they come around but they never come close to
i can see it inside your face
you're in the wrong place
cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up
with bullet holes and such
speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
you can put your whole army against my team and
i guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
your simple words just don't move me
you're minor, we're major
you all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
don't make me have to call your name out
your crew is featherweight
my gunshots'll make you levitate
i'm only nineteen but my mind is old
and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
another figga deceased, another story gets told
it ain't nothin' really
hey, yo dun spark the phillie
so i can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
why they still alive i don't know, go figure
meanwhile back in l.a the foundation
if i die i couldn't choose a better location
when the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
getting closer to god in a tight situation
now, take these words home and think it through
or the next rhyme i write might be about you

chorus:
son, they shook...
there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death, scared to look
they shook
there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death, scared to look

livin' the live with the diamonds and guns
there's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns
cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones
you ain't a crook son, you just a shook one

there's a war going on outside
no man is safe from
you can run but you can't hide forever
in these streets that we done took
you walking with your head down scared to look
you shook cause there anit no such thing as half way crooks
there never around when the beef cooks
and my part of town is similar to vietnam
now we all grown up and hold heavy on the cops control
you better have the right gear get ready
tryin back me and get rock steady
by the mac one double i'll touch you
leave you with not much to go home with
my skin is thick
cause i be up in the mix of action
if i'm not at home puffin lie relaxin
la got a nigga depressed
so i wear a slug-proof underneath my guess
in the life filled with diamonds and guns
there's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
but some get shot,lock-down,and turn nuns
cowardly hearts say straight up shook ones
you shook

there ain't no things as half way crooks
( you ani't a crook son)
you sarced to death you scared to look you shook
(you just a shook one)
there ain't no things as half way crooks
(you ani't a crook son)
you scared to death you sacred to look you shook
(you just a shook one)
there ain't no such things as half way crooks
you scared to death you scared to look you shook
there ain't no such things as half way crooks
you scared to death you scared to look you shook

you ain't a crook son
you just a shook one
you ani't a crook son

so you know
there's a way, out of no way
swear i know everything's gonna be okay

i could spare a rib to get my baby back
i just wanna fall asleep where my baby at
so i don't wake up wondering where my baby at
i wonder if we'll make it back
i wonder ""can i pay her back, please""
65th and ingleside
way before jamie got his jingles right
i was sleeping with you every single night
but i was still tryna act single right
65th and ingleside
i was stacking chips like bingo night
i didn't have to pay for a single light
so i'ma make sure everything go right


there's a way, out of no way
swear i know everything's gonna be okay
so you know
there's a way, out of no way
swear i know everything's gonna be okay
gonna be okay


your sister owned the house we lived in
on the east side that you rented
little two flat, inexpensive
i didn't have a glove to pitch in
i didn't have a pot to piss in
not to mention in dro city
not a lot of jobs with pensions
all my raps was 'bout suspension
then one day donald took me on tour
young broke chano ain't broke no more
thought you wouldn't want me come and darken your doorstep
but i still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th and ingleside
moved downtown for a single life
none of my stars ever twinkled bright
'til god decide to come bring you by


there's a way, out of no way
swear i know everything's gonna be okay
so you know
there's a way, out of no way
swear i know everything's gonna be okay
gonna be okay


where's the return on investment? my first a&r
that shit was played unless you would hit play in the car
we hit the shell station, i tell you stay in the car
back in the spot, don't put it in park
leave that bitch running in case i come running
and skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold scar
there it get late 'fore it's dark
kensli couldn't play in the park
now she could play in the stars
high rise, eye to eye with fireworks
so high your ears fire, they might've burst
every time they buy a verse, i buy a purse
but you can't buy back time, that's just not how it works
three jobs, you afforded the crib
fuck child support, you supported the kid
a full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
so you first up, go in order of dibs
my big homie told me, ""nigga growth and development
go and settle down, don't settle for settlement""
she got you closer to god than you two ever been
she moved over from evanston, you moved over from eggleston
first lady you knew, you can't marry her?
got shit sonny, now you can't share?
new dad step in, you can’t stare?
you knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer
on 65th and ingleside
feel like you remember every single lie
truth is i just really need your finger size
so i can make sure that they make the ring so tight


there's a way, out of no way

i heard a call from the mountain top: ""joba!""
so i put my cloak on and i walked
coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
we left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
now other people from my village want to come with me
the thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
you did not believe, they did not believe
you can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
you're not one with me
i bought a horse with the shillings that you took
and then gave back to me
i met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
i bought a castle in the shire with the moat and the catapult

martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
why you gotta hate? looking at my pace
with your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
never even cared to appear or adhere my career
trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
i won't be the one to rush that shift
couldn't crush my gift even if i'm in a thousand pieces
listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
to my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
all i know is they wanted to move without me
how they used to doubt me, but you can’t renounce me
like la, la, la, la

yeah, this album is dedicated
to all the teachers that told me i'd never amount to nothin'
to all the people that lived above the buildings that i was hustlin' in front of
called the police on me when i was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
and all the niggas in the struggle
you know what i'm sayin'? it's all good, baby baby


it was all a dream, i used to read word up! magazine
salt-n-pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
hangin' pictures on my wall
every saturday rap attack, mr. magic, marley marl
i let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
smokin' weed in bambú, sippin' on private stock
way back, when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin' duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
you never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
now i'm in the limelight 'cause i rhyme tight
time to get paid, blow up like the world trade
born sinner, the opposite of a winner
remember when i used to eat sardines for dinner
peace to ron g, brucie b, kid capri
funkmaster flex, lovebug starski
i'm blowin' up like you thought i would
call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good

reach for the stars
you had a goal
but not that many
'cause you're the only one
i'll give you good and plenty


i made the change from a common thief
to up close and personal with robin leach
and i'm far from cheap, i smoke skunk with my peeps all day
spread love, it's the brooklyn way
the moët and alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
now they write letters 'cause they miss me
i never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
i was too used to packing gats and stuff
now honeys play me close like butter play toast
from the mississippi down to the east coast
condos in queens, indo for weeks
sold out seats to hear biggie smalls speak
living life without fear
puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
considered a fool 'cause i dropped out of high school
stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and it's still all good
and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

who you are
don't let 'em hold you down
reach for the stars
you had a goal
but not that many
'cause you're the only one

super nintendo, sega genesis
when i was dead broke, man, i couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
phone bill about two g's flat
no need to worry, my accountant handles that
and my whole crew is loungin'
celebrating every day, no more public housin'
thinkin' back on my one-room shack
now my mom pimps an ac' with minks on her back
and she loves to show me off of course
smiles every time my face is up in the source
we used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
no heat, wonder why christmas missed us
birthdays was the worst days
now we sip champagne when we thirsty
uh, damn right i like the life i live
'cause i went from negative to positive and it's all (it's all good, nigga)

it's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
put in positions off in the clair, all that i had to do was stare

beg my pardon to martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'

i know you're the reason i believe in life
what's the day without a little night?

Mockingbird|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yeah, i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. but hey, what'd daddy always tell you? straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! what you cryin' about? you got me


hailie, i know you miss your mom, and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone, but i'm tryin' to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'cause you're scared, i ain't there
daddy's with you in your prayers
no more cryin', wipe them tears
daddy's here, no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it
we gon' do it, lainie—uncle's crazy, ain't he?
yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
we're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
when it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
lookin' puzzled, in a daze, i know it's confusin' you
daddy's always on the move, momma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that, the more it backfires on me
all the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us, i don't see us ever bein'
together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream


now hush, little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise, momma's gon' be alright (heh)


it's funny, i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas, i sat up the whole night cryin'
'cause daddy felt like a bum—see, daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time, every house that we lived in
either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
on to chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr. dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein' daddy on the tv, and momma didn't like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone, momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house
just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
lainie, i'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
i like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
sshh! momma's only gone for the moment


now hush, little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise, momma's gon' be alright


and if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
i'ma give you the world
i'ma buy a diamond ring for you, i'ma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
i'ma break that birdie's neck
i'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad! (ha-ha!)"
Buggin' Out|A Tribe Called Quest|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
the five foot assassin with the roughneck business
i float like gravity, never had a cavity
got more rhymes than the winans got family
no need to sweat arsenio to gain some type of fame
no shame in my game cause i'll always be the same
styles upon styles upon styles is what i have
you wanna diss the phifer but you still don't know the half
i sport new balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
i never half step cause i'm not a half stepper
drink a lot of soda so they call me dr. pepper
refuse to compete with bs competition
your name ain't special ed
so won't you seckle with the mission
i never walk the street thinking it's all about me
even though deep in my heart, it really could be
i just try my best to like go all out
some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out


zulu nation, brothers last creation
minds get flooded, ejaculation
right on the two inch tape
the abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
to get my point across, so bust, the floss
as i go in between, the grit and the dirt
listen to the mission listen miss as i do work, umm
as i crack the, monotone
children of the jazz so, get your own
smokin r&b cause they try to do me
or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
for it's abstract, original
you can't get your own and that's, pitiful
i know i'd be the man if i cold yanked the plug
on r&b, but i can't and that's bugged


buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out


yo when you bug out
you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding, always surrounding
pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
you don't really fret, you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
you soar off to another world, deep in your mind
but people seem to take that, as being unkind
""oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough, sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nike's
if a crowd is in my realm i'm saying -- mic please
hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
if you do the result, will end up kind of bugged


yo, i am not an invalid although
i used to smoke the weed out
ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out
scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
when i left for road, see, i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his maddest
it was one mc after one mc
what the world could they be wanting see from little old me
do i have the formula to save the world?
or was it just because i used to
swipe the women and all the girls
i'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man
but now i wonder cause you're feeble
i go out with the strongies and i separate the evils
it's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
all you nasty critters even though you see i bug out

finally out the muthafuckin' cpt
off to other cities and shit
no longer just an underground hit
movin thangs, a local nigga made good
i made a name off of making tapes for niggas in the hood
and now, let me tell a little story
about the places that i been to and the shit that i been through
like fightin' and shootouts and bangin and shit
all because a nigga made a hit, check it
1991, it was double or nothing, not a nigga wit' hit
then we broke out with the fonky shit
about bitches and niggas and gettin' drunk and off that bud
i was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
but foolish was i to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
and they didn't like this
that compton was the home of a foot in yo' ass
where you got blast, and now that's just a thing of the past
let me tell ya why firsthand
we did a show up in oak-land and niggas was kickin up sand
to them bangin' ain't nothin' new, and slangin' ain't nothin' new
and for every nigga we done shot, they done shot two
straight doin' locs since the sixties, before i was born
families of young niggas mourn
so i'm just letting you know
that if ya plan to take a trip to the bay
keep your hand on your clip

because oakland (ha ha ha, is just like compton)
yeah, i'm telling y'all oakland (ha ha ha, is just like compton, fool)


moving on to st. louis, where they country as fuck
with gold teeth in they mouth but they still know what's up
where it's hot as a muthafucka, hot enough to make ya cuss
that's why i kept my ass on the bus
but later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends
who put us up on the st. louis cap
the smith center, with big bob, little steve, tojo, biss and rich
and a couple of bitches
then they took us to a man named gus in a store
he put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore
that's when i started thinking that this wasn't like home
but then they had to prove me wrong
'cause later that night after we did the show
we went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
yeah, bloods and crips start scrappin' and shootin' -- in missouri?
damn, how could this happen?

now st. louis (ha ha ha, is just like compton)
yeah y'all, st. louis (ha ha ha ha, is just like compton, nigga)


i don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
they need to stop watchin' that colors and boyz n the hood
too busy claimin sixties, tryin to be raw
and never ever seen the 'shaw
but now, back to the story that i'm tellin'
we packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin'
when we arrived i saw red and blue sweatsuits
when i'm thinkin' 'bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots
i guess texas ain't no different from the rest
and san antonio, was just waitin' to put us to the test
and before it was over the shit got deep
a nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
then they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin'
little did they know that we was packin'
yeah, we was puttin' 'em down and scaring the rest, shit
i even had to wear the bulletproof vest

now san antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like compton)
yeah, san antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like compton, bitch)


after about a month on the road
we came home and i can safely say
that l.a. is a much better place to stay
how could a bunch of niggas in a town like this
have such a big influence on niggas so far away?
but still my story ain't over 'cause i got one more to tell
and the people of colorado, they know it well
it was all in the news and if you don't remember
i had this show i did in denver
with a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink
bitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit
to the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
but i'm getting paid so i didn't pay it no mind
then i poured out my brew onto their face and chest
then they start throwin' soda, and fuckin' up my guess
when it was over two niggas needed stitches
got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches

now denver (ha ha ha, is just like compton)
yeah, y'all denver (ha ha ha, they wanna be like compton, bitch)
and you know that oakland (ha ha ha, is just like compton)
yeah, y'all, st. louis (ha ha ha ha, we made it just like compton, fool)
uh-huh, san antonio (ha ha ha ha ha, is just like compton)

Bow Down|Westside Connection|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
the world is mine nigga get back
don't fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
about to drop the bomb i'm the motherfuckin' don
big fish in a small pond
now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
but i shook they worm and they hook
guppies hold they breath. they want to miss me when i'm tipsy
running everything west of the mississippi
its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
we got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
bow down before i make a phone call
got 25 niggas running up on y'all
for the cheese we want them keys
everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
before any of you guppies get heart
nigga rewind my part fool and....(bow down)


(bow down) when i come to your town
(bow down) when i'm westward bound
(bow down) cuz i ain't a hater like you
bow down to a nigga that's greater than you


i take ten steps and i draw (blaow!)
now who's dissin' the mad-ass inglewood addition
i bust like a pimple, my mind is illmental
the westside connects with me and south central
and a drag from the zig zag can't fuck with the philly's
holdin' down the wild west like a kid they call billy
once again it's mack 10 the gold crown holda
strong as a coca-cola with a chrome pistola
now who wanna fuss so i can buss when i cuss
my look bring you fear with gear from the surplus
since a teen i chased the green, the crack scene king
lolos, corniches and baguettes on my pieces
so recognize these real g's, chase the cheese
the westside connect keep it rolling like gold d's
three-wheeling and dealing is like the california style
but in the meanwhile in my town you got to bow


(bow down) when you come to my town
(bow down) when i'm westward bound
(bow down) because i ain't a hater like you
bow down to a nigga that's greater than you


well it's that, chuck wearing, still sporting a beanie
the shadiest nigga in the clique, who want to see me
as i slide my locs on let my khakis hang
westside connect gang, connect gang, bing bing bang (west side)
run away run away or get your punk ass slayed
by this h double o to the d to the s.t.a
fuck hiding it, i'm gang related simple and plain
which means i could give a fuck about you niggas in this rap game
flashy niggas get stuck up, beat the fuck up
when you come around, keep your chain tucked from this
zero zero apostrophe s shit
fuck a studio lyricist i'm real with this
talk the talk walk the walk
diss me on wax, i'm trying to saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
i'm platinum bound so bitch shut up
and nigga all y'all could kiss my converse like sho nuff


(bow down) when i come to your town
(bow down) when i'm westward bound
(bow down) cuz i ain't a hater like you
bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

(group)
(bow down) when you come to our town
(bow down) when we westward bound
(bow down) cuz we ain't no haters like you
bow down to some niggas that's greater than you


yea. ha. let me tell you something
gangsta's make the world go round
so you ain't got to clown
but if you live on the west side of your town
make them other fools bow down
westside connection. the world belongs to us

(group)
(bow down) when you come to our town
(bow down) when we westward bound
(bow down) cuz we ain't no haters like you
bow down to some niggas that's greater than you

guess who's back, back again
shady's back, tell a friend
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back, guess who's back
guess who's back


i've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more, they want shady, i'm chopped liver
well, if you want shady, this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not co-operating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
you waited this long, now stop debating
‘cause i'm back, i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job, ms. cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me, so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that! cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, debbie!


now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy
‘cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me

little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""bitch!""
a visionary, vision is scary
could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
a rebel, so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
and it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
well, i'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then i'm gonna
enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention, back for the winter
i'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing, ""attention please""
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
a nuisance, who sent? you sent for me?


now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy
‘cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy

a tisk-it a task-it, i'll go tit for tat with
anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
chris kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby? you can get stomped by obie
you 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
you don't know me, you're too old, let go
it's over, nobody listens to techno
now let's go, just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me, i'm just obscene
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy (hey!)
there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me


now this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy
‘cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
‘cause we need a little controversy

you say ""one for the treble, two for the time""
come on!
speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
now let it fall, (huh!)


my restlessness is my nemesis
it's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
i write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
i mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
selector, wheel it back, i'm feeling that
from the core to the perimeter black
you know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (mos def)
full blooded, full throttle
breathe deep inside the drum hollow... there's the hum
young man, where you from? brooklyn number one!
native son, speaking in the native tongue
i got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
while you still tryin to find where it is
i'm on the ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
used to speak the king's en-ga-lish
but caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
long range from the base-line (swish)
move like an apparition, float to the ground with ammunition
(chi-chi-pow) move from the gate, voice cued
on your tape, putting food on your plate
many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
we went from picking cotton
to chain gang line chopping, to be-bopping, to hip-hopping
blues people got the blue chip stock option
invisible man, got the whole world watching
(where ya at?) i'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
i'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
where you can either get paid or get shot
when your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
when your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
don't gas yourself, akh'
the industry just a better built cell block
a long way from the shell tops
and the bells that l rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)


the more emotion i put into it, the harder i rock


hip hop is prosecution evidence
an out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
sick without benefits (hungh!) luxury tenements
choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
it is a back water remedy
bitter and tender memory, a class e felony
facing the death penalty (hungh!)
stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
violently competitive, a school unaccredited
the break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
hip hop went from selling crack to smoking it
medicine for loneliness remind me of thelonius and dizzy
propers to b-boys getting busy
the war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
a two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
olympic sponsor of the black glock
gold medalist in the back shot
from the sovereign state of the have-nots
where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
it's all-city like phase 2
hip hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you"

lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
a lot of shit happens, like, like, i make a lot of money, you know
and i'm really happy about it
and i'm not bragging, i just wanna say something
i make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
but wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
hey, if my father was alive today, i would go home and say
""dad, i wanna tell you how much money i made""
you know what he'd say? ""you's a lying motherfucker
joe louis didn't make that much money
come in here, get your ass out the house
coming here with that bullshit,"" hah


niggas hating on me, i ain't used to that
know a couple people wanna shoot for that
i say ""no, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that""
them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
and if it work for them, well shit, i'm cool with that
'cause how they feel, i ain't got shit to do with that
i just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
and trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

(whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


it's been a long time since i have felt this way
about something but now, but now
i'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
the nights are cold, the lost is found, i'm found

hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that

hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my unc'
uncle sam and shit
""what's up unc'? yup. hey, i told you that check was coming in, i gotchu when it came in. goddamn, i'm a man of my word. goddamn, i told you i'ma have it, and goddamn, i'ma have it for you. hell, shit, damn right. now, how much was it though? uh huh. huh? half? half nigga? you crazy, boy, you crazy. bitch, you crazy as fuck. bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!


yeah, i pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
where do my dollars go? you see lately, i ain't been convinced
i guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
but my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
maybe 'cause the tax dollars that i make sure i send
get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
and the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars i spend
got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
one thing about the men that's controlling the pen
that write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
maybe we'll never see a black man in the white house again
i'll write a check to the irs, my pockets get slim
damn, do i even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
some older nigga told me to start votin'
i said ""democracy is too fuckin' slow""
if i'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, i wanna know
better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
let me pick the things i'm funding from an app on my screen
better that than letting wack congressman i've never seen
dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country and then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
from the concrete, he was prolly rose
now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
he did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
so right now, he got two on the way
still sleep on covers in his mama house
she can't take this shit no more, she want him out
on the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
she remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

Beautiful|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
lately i've been hard to reach
i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world
where they can be alone
are you calling me?
are you trying to get through?
are you reaching out for me
then i'm reaching out for you


i'm just so fuckin' depressed
i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need somethin' to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises, took my lumps
fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when
i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent
but i just can't admit or come to grips with the fact
that i may be done with rap, i need a new outlet
and i know some shit's so hard to swallow
but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow, but i know one fact:
i'll be one tough act to follow, one tough act to follow
i'll be one tough act to follow
here today, gone tomorrow
but you'd have to walk a thousand miles—


in my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you


i think i'm starting to lose my sense of humor
everything's so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature
of the room, just as soon as
i walk in, it's like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
‘cause if i do that, then it opens a door
for conversation like i want that
i'm not lookin' for extra attention
i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no fuckin' man-servant
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""ha!
marshall, you're so funny, man
you should be a comedian, goddamn!""
unfortunately i am
i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down?
listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—


in my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you


nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we're dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip 'em, don't expect no help
now, i could've either just sat on my ass
and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i'm placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in in every single place
every school i went, i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant acting stupid
aunt edna always told me:
""keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
meanwhile, i'm just standin' there
holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
at eight years old; i learned my lesson then
‘cause i wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
‘cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
it's probably 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each other's shoes at least
what size you wear? i wear 10's
let's see if you can fit your feet—


in my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you


lately i've been hard to reach
i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world
where they can be alone
are you calling me?
are you trying to get through?
are you reaching out for me
then i'm reaching out for you


yeah, to my babies: stay strong
daddy'll be home soon
and to the rest of the world
god gave you them shoes to fit you
so put 'em on and wear 'em
be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
even if it sounds corny
never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful"

It Ain't Hard to Tell|Nas|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


it ain't hard to tell, i excel, then prevail
the mic is contacted, i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shining, sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
hit the earth like a comet—invasion!
nas is like the afrocentric asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘cause in my physical i can express through song
delete stress like motrin, then extend strong
i drink moët with medusa, give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell


the buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
not stories by aesop
place your loot up, parties i shoot up
nas, i analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the l
school a fool well, you feel it like braille
it ain't hard to tell, i kick a skill, like shaquille holds a pill
vocabulary spills, i'm ill plus matic
i freak beats, slam it, like iron sheik
jam like a tec with correct techniques
so analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
i leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell


this rhythmatic explosion
is what your frame of mind has chosen
i'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
end like leviathan, it's deep? well, let me try again
wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
i dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
street's disciple, i rock beats that's mega trifle
and groove even smoother than moves by villanova
you're still a soldier, i'm like sly stone in cobra
packin' like a rasta in the weed spot
vocals will squeeze glocks
mcs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell"

i breaks it down to the bone gristle
ill speaking scud missile heat seeking
johnny blazing, nightmares like wes craven
niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
you know about them fucking staten kids, they smashing
everything huh in any shape form or fashion
now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
is you busting steel or is you flashing? hmmm
talking out your asshole
you should have learnt about the flow and peasy afro
ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
from my naps to the bunion on my big toe
i keeps it moving, know just what the fuck i'm doing
rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist hip hop possess me
crunch a nigga like a nestle, you know my steez
burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
the head toucher, industry party bum rusher
you don’t like it? dick up in you, fuck ya!


allow me to demonstrate
that's right, you corny-ass
the skill of shaolin, rap motherfuckers
the special technique, better go back and check
of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
and your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch


i slayed mcs back in the rec room era
my style broke motherfucking backs like ken patera
most rap niggas came loud but unheard
once i pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate
industry, but what them niggas can't see
must break through like the wu, unexpectedly
protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
before i blast the mic, rza scratch off the serial
we reign all year round from june to june
while niggas bite immediately if not soon
set the lynching and form the execution date
as this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
cause rza to charge niggas twenty gs a session


when my mind start to clicking and the strategy
is mastered the plot thicken
this be that wu shit
i don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
about a brother tryna size a nigga up, i hold my own
hard-hat protect your dome
look at mama baby boy acting like he grown
no time for sleep, i gets deep as a baritone
killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
wu brother number one, protect your neck
flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
to the next episode, i keeps it grungy
hand on my nut sack and spitting lunghies
at a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
when it come to rza tracks i don't know how to act
real rap from the stat, killa hill projects
how to be exact, break it down
all in together now
things are getting good looking better now
...and some other shit


allow me to demonstrate the skill of shaolin

i ain't a killer, but don't push me
revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
bow down, pray to god, hopin' that he's listenin'
seein' niggas comin' for me and my diamonds when they glistenin'
now pay attention: bless me please, father, i'm a ghost
in these killing fields, hail mary, catch me if i go
let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
activate my hate, let it break to the flame
set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
plus, mama told me never stop until i bust a nut
fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, hail mary

mixed in, now i'm twisted, blistered and high
visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
forever live, and i multiply, survived by thugs
when i die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs


peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
ready to wet the party up
and whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
my heat seeks suckers on the regular
mashin' in a stolen black ac' integra
cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when i'm deadin' ya
feet first, you've got a nice gat but my heat's worse
from a thug to preachin' church
i gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
needin' work, and i ain't the nigga to put you on

Eazy-er Said Than Dunn|Eazy-E|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yo man i don't think they heard you
why don't you tell 'em what ya name is


my name is eazy yeah this is true
keepin' your attention is what i'm gonna do
hardcore yo i could never be soft
askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
quiet on the set because i'm about to begin
and if you didn't hear me boy i'll tell you again
my name is eazy or just call me e
but it doesn't really matter to me
cause i'm the same person
whether serious or rehearsin'
i just gotta keep cursin'
this is for the radio so i better chill
they won't play it if i cold get ill
but i'm like that and thats an actually fact
because the street is where my heart is at
yo i don't do dope but i'm dope not a dope
but i'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
if the rhyme i'm displayin'
and the beat that's playin'
yo you could try all day
and you still won't match up with the ruthless p.o.w
cause eazy's doin it compton style
thats the city and you say you could get some
yo it's eazy-er said than dunn


wooooooo!
wooooooo!


now it's easy for me to get my point across
so listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
i'm not a role model or a dr. seuss yo i'm a gangsta
and i'm about to get stupid
i guess its time for the trama
with the e-a-z-y-e comma now that's drama
so pay attention by the way i must mention
i'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
with the glare
but you don't need no glasses to stare
it'll probably take you in and it's just like you're there
with the e on the gangsta tip
so if you think i'm a flip or slip don't even trip
cause i'm a destroyer
my homie dre is a doctor not a lawyer
dope mc employer on ruthless and that's my label
to get the money, the women, and cold bust the fat cables, boy
master rhyme's a toy
i mean straight, while you suckin' with the girls enjoy
you must be sick, or you lonely
how you gonna diss me if you don't even know me?
yo ren!
whassup?
get the gat show 'em where it's at
and that's just the sound
and next time i'm peelin your cap
to let you know where i'm comin' from
eazy said it and it shall be dunn


wooooooo!
wooooooo!


creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
eazy-er said than dunn yeah thats the title
rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
but what if she's ugly?
eazy come eazy go
don't ask to battle me, homeboy, what's that?
you wanna battle me, boy ya better be strapped
cause where i'm from it ain't all about that playin'

now that's what i'm sayin'
said before that i was born in '73
now everybody wants to know the a-g-e
girls on the tip, fellas too, it seemed
had everybody thinkin' i was only 15
the fellas would annoy me
the ladies would adore me
and what was i to do
i wishin' nothin' but to let the lady's through
cause the ladies i love 'em
nice and then soft
i hate male groupies so just step the hell off
i'm the real eazy cause others be fakin'
tryin' to game fame off the name i'm makin'
sayin' on your records you could get some
yo home boy its eazy-er said than dunn


wooooooo!
wooooooo!"

front to back, top to bottom


everything's changing around me
these days don't feel the same
we all lost faith and lost family
why must we play this game?
lord have mercy on me
i've been a sinning man
pull out my wings, jump off the bridge
and crash in a plane, if i never land


know i never die
we live forever in my mind
and i sanctify
we live forever, still alive


there's a lot going on but i stick to the ones i love
i never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was
consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out
it was like, may, i just moved to l.a., i was tryna figure it out
medication for depression that i cut cold turkey, had the kid manic
in an episode out in hollywood, wilding out like nick cannon
railing adderall pills out a dollar bill, on the bathroom floor
clean the whole mess up with my nose, what the fuck i need a vacuum for?
new york city on my birthday, june 6th, 2014
i had that first meeting with hov, plus i brought out the whole team
i drank that whole bottle of d'usse ty ty gave me that night
when we left the club, at the rap genius house me and shorty got into a fight
she came out the room swingin', hit me in the jaw
i was really tryna fend her off
but i ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck
i was tripping, dawg
too proud to apologize or empathize, i blamed it all on her
saying that she hit me first, even though she was the one hurt
i was really just reflecting all the hurt that i was feeling from the band's rejection
when kids these days split, that shit felt like a c-section
and my infidelity and jealousy with natalie on top of the amphetamines
and the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the chesapeake
the next month i dropped ""down on my luck"" and had europe going nuts
but i couldn't even appreciate it at the time, i was going through too much
now i had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records
in ibiza eating paella on the roof, tryna choose over breakfast
hov wasn't with the bidding war, but i knew the roc just felt right
when i saw kanye at wireless, without t-pain, still a good life
felt so close when mr. hudson introduced me to him backstage
he prolly don't even remember that shit... like a bitch off backpage
but at that stage, i was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage
at the same time, i was winding down a low point in my addict phase
the adderall started wearing off and i went into a deep writer's block
all over a song that i couldn't finish that i wrote about signin' to the roc
isn't that ironic? i was feeling so psychotic
with the whole world excited for me and my idol saying i got it
shit got bad out in l.a., so i moved back home to my mom's basement
linked up with smoko and papi beatz and took it back to basics
then i wrote ""rage,"" that was me screaming out through the pain
and ""u mad,"" addressing my relationship with natalie, it was too bad
the violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health
i did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself
as i started to fall apart, certain stars started to align
om'mas came to chicago in january at the perfect time
he said kanye was working on an album, and uzi played him one of our songs
he was tryna fly me out, nigga, it was goin' down like the dow jones
pulled up to westlake, first day i was there, i recorded ""wolves""
i knew i was the one, like neo meeting with the oracle
but i had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled
crawled out on snl
all the niggas hating on me back home lookin' at me like, ""fml""
a lot of people coming out the wood like, ""let's work,"" tryna network
all the pressure making my head hurt, the molly wouldn't let the meds work
at this time it's like feb. 1st to the 15th, and i'm still addicted
frustrated, writing shit for ye, tryna visualize someone else's vision
then he laid that verse on ""u mad"" and we made the shit the single
ye and hov getting into it over me, tryna do a joint venture
and g.o.o.d. music still fam, but it's that roc boy savemoney life
took the bus out on the road for the traffic tour, did a hundred nights
cleaned out my closet, i got rid of all of my demons
if you learn one thing from my journey, nigga it's don't stop believing
when this shit got so suffocating i could barely even keep breathing
wrote my wrongs all in this song now i'd like to welcome y'all to my season
nigga i'm gone


know i never die
we live forever in my mind
and i sanctify
we live forever, still alive"

Survival Tactics|Styles Of Beyond|hip-hop-rap-trap|"point missed, lesson learned by way the table tops turned
to my concern, you failed to practice, survival tactics and got burned
in one ear and out the back of my impact year
to boost your self-esteem and camouflage your wack career
got yourself the flops and flossin' but you forget
that your one hit ain't feedin' them 5 babies n' {shit}
keep the fat rat rich and he'll backflip
bending over wack words, like you expect, i got you facin' backwards
right back where you started, cold, gettin' retarded
thinkin' back, bustin' for nothin' but table scraps
fish all that, we're on a fully loaded expedition
for suckers actin' shifty like a manual transmission
ammunition comes in a black cloak
sneak up on 'em, let the suckers fly once, then i snap his throat
the infamous, los angeles, lyricist
san fernando val, southern cal when they experience it


here it comes, some survival tactics
we keep it movin' in the place, ain't no time for practice
that's how we do, make the crowd shout is all that counts
and all amounts, gettin' love, makin' heads bounce
survival tactics

now, whether you like it or not, we still arrive
bright and early up in yo' face with somethin' live
spinnin' on the carousel but fail to realize
i'm the supreme energizer no (yeah) rhyme state
nothin' but a circus with a flying trapeze of emcees
not to talk {shit} but, man, please
headquarters units alarm, styles of beyond
comin' through military troops to bring battles call
a roadmap to the island of survival
wallow at the kids that love to do what i do
bleach'll make you jump and get ridiculous
preparin' for the ride, grab my popcorn and licorice
chill, have a seat, get a drink, maybe watch
but if it ain't the real, second thought, maybe not
this'll make the time for when it's really time to drop
collect the navy seals, scuba dive for hip hop (hip hop)


here it comes, some survival tactics
we keep it movin' in the place, ain't no time for practice
that's how we do, make the crowd shout is all that counts
and all amounts, gettin' love, makin' heads bounce
survival tactics

what goes up must come down, gravity kills
but, tragically, emcees got more egos than skills
watch your back, whip the car seat with a closed fist
cause it's survival of the fit, man, even the strong get dissed

so now we drop down, parachutes, backtrack it slow
through the roof, survival tactics on the loose
secret agent combination, junkyard, daily route
sell the star ranks, snatchin' piggy banks that escape
load the armored tank with the ammo and the ratchets
man, you know the time (what's the time?), time for action

what's the reaction, keep a close caption
collapsin' emcees, wanna be stuck on something like michael jackson
within a split second of a fraction, ryu's attackin
with the first of a strapped regiment assassin


here it comes, some survival tactics
we keep it movin' in the place, ain't no time for practice
that's how we do, make the crowd shout is all that counts

to my comrades that keep it flamin' hot
on dangerous blocks, claimin' spots
where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers
forty-five holders, one of the high rollers
get respect in the hood, credit is good. knock it down
lumberjack style, baby; extra wood
rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon baby

pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
it's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids
what part of the game this is in foreign languages
they hold ra's events in different continents
put my lyrical contents in monuments
in ghetto garments, i rock a towel like a pharaoh
mind travel, design style like apparel
my fashions last long as a lifetime
‘cause i can see the future when the god write rhymes
they're mad ‘cause i managed to reign so long

Wing$|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i was seven years old when i got my first pair
and i stepped outside, and i was like ""momma
this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly""
i hit that court, and when i jumped
i jumped, i swear i got so high
""i touched the net! mom, i touched the net!
this is the best day of my life""
air maxes were next, that air bubble, that mesh
the box, the smell, the stuffing, the thread, at school
i was so cool, i knew that i couldn't crease 'em
my friends couldn't afford 'em, four stripes on their adidas
on the court i wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros, yo
stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
nike air flight, book bag was so dope
and then my friend carlos's brother got murdered for his fours
whoa
see he just wanted a jump shot
but they wanted his starter coat, though
didn't wanna get caught from genesee park to othello
you'd get clowned for those pro wings, with the velcro, those were not tight
i was tryna fly, without leaving the ground
'cause i wanted to be like mike, right, wanted to be him
i wanted to be that guy, i wanted to touch the rim
i wanted to be cool, and i wanted to fit in
i wanted what he had, america, it begins


i wanna fly, can you take me far away?
give me a star to reach for
tell me what it takes
and i'll go so high, i'll go so high
my feet won't touch the ground
just stitch my wings and pull the strings
i bought these dreams that all fall down


we want what we can't have
the commodity makes us want it
so expensive, damn, i just got to flaunt it
got to show 'em
so exclusive, this that new shit
a hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, i would never hoop in
look at me, look at me, i'm a cool kid
i'm an individual, yeah, but i'm part of a movement
my movement told me ""be a consumer""
and i consumed it
they told me to just do it
i listened to what that swoosh said
look at what that swoosh did
see it consumed my thoughts
""are you stupid? don’t crease 'em! just leave 'em in that box!""
strangled by these laces, laces i can barely talk
that's my air bubble and i'm lost, if it pops
we are what we wear, we wear what we are
but see i look inside the mirror and think phil knight tricked us all
will i stand for change, or stay in my box?
these nikes help me define me
but i'm trying to take mine off


i wanna fly, can you take me far away?
give me a star to reach for
tell me what it takes
and i'll go so high, i'll go so high
my feet won't touch the ground
just stitch my wings and pull the strings
i bought these dreams that all fall down


they started out with what i wear to school
that first day
like these are what make you cool
and this pair, this would be my parachute
so much more than just a pair of shoes
nah, this is what i am
what i wore, this is the source of my youth
this dream that they sold to you
for a hundred dollars and some change
consumption is in the veins
and now i see it's just another pair of shoes"

long flights playin' with my brain
long nights, long summers we in spain
car color of la haine
she getting naked under covers for the fame
she don't wanna be another what's-her-name
brown skin, blonde brain, etta james
make it rain, in the club
don't you dream of how it feel to be in love?
what, you drinking? need a buzz?
don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound

I Tried|Bone Thugs-N-Harmony|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
bone thugs, akon, yeah
you know, don't nothin' come easy
you gotta try real real hard
i've tried hard
but i guess i gotta try harder


i've tried so hard
i can't seem to get away from misery
man, i've tried so hard
but will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault, ‘cause i
try to get away but trouble follows me
and still i try so hard
hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then i'll be posted up
right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
but until then i'll be posted up
right here with my heat, gettin' dough


first let me explain that i'm just a black man
and i come from the dark side
so i'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
my mind be racin', and i don't even know what i'm chasin' yet
been in and out of relationships
i'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
but i'm layin' back, prayin' that
you give that peace of mind to me
i thought i was right, but really i'm wrong
and again i was too blind to see
i was in the fast lane, chasin' my dreams
and then it seems like when the fame and cash came
they just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
i've been so faded, tryin' to erase it
but i just can't, ‘cause the drama just grows greater
and i've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later


i've tried so hard
i can't seem to get away from misery
man, i've tried so hard
but will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault, ‘cause i
try to get away but trouble follows me

but until then i'll be posted up
right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
but until then i'll be posted up
right here with my heat, gettin' dough


it's like i'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
tryin' to get ahead of the game
but i can't seem to get it on track
and i keep runnin' away from the ones
that say they love me the most
how could i create the distance
when it's supposed to be close?
and uh, i just don't know, but i be out here fightin' demons
and it's like a curse that i can't shake this part of cleveland
and lord, would you help me?
and stop this pain i keep inflictin' on my family?
hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
and losin' sight of what i'm supposed to be handlin'
it's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
and man i'm slippin', can't lose my balance
i'm tryin' not to panic


i've tried so hard
i can't seem to get away from misery
man, i've tried so hard
but will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault, ‘cause i
try to get away but trouble follows me
and still i try so hard
hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then i'll be posted up
right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
but until then i'll be posted up
right here with my heat, gettin' dough


i see that things won't change
i'm stuck in the game
as soon as i get out, it keeps pullin' me back, mane
got me doin' dirty dirt
so used to this hustlin' money
that i don't understand no 9-to-5 work
studied on the streets, hustlas know what i mean
hustlas ballin' before us
i'm tryin' to make it to that major league
so we will never leave until the sun came up
gotta get it – no, nope, not leavin' no budge
today games they play
gotta go hard to get what you put in
if you fall off then it's all on you
gotta watch what you sign to
try so hard, but i won't pull through


i've tried so hard
i can't seem to get away from misery
man, i've tried so hard
but will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault, ‘cause i
try to get away but trouble follows me

to the sound that's legit, i've come to make a hit
i usually bust scratches with my brother, c.l. smooth
but, i decided to get wreck on this groove
as i provide the slide you're going on a ride
i know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
pete rock and c.l. smooth all the honey-dips admire
beats are rough and rugged, pete rock is the creator
now i'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
making sure my sound hits from here to grenada
honey gave me skins, man, i told her friends i ate her
but, wait up, i save this subject for later
but, it's time to get wreck with the creator


i'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(yo, pete, there's a girl on the phone)
tell her to hold cause i'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
fortified with soul cause that's what i give 'em
honeys form a line form a line cause i always seem to capture
beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
if you try to step to this, don't even consider it
skins when i want 'em, but, only when i need 'em
to set the record straight, i'll be damned if eat 'em
call me pete rock, i make the girls flock
and if you want a beat like this, i got them in stock
so, flow with the flow, because you know i'm good to go
as i proceed to get wreck on your stereo
not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
but, it's time to get wreck with the creator

now, c.l. smooth, cut it up like this
(scratching)


now, i'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
if they give me one sec to get some wreck
never filled with anger, a good body banger
if you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
before i say good-bye suckers gave a good try
but, point blank you just can't see this
my word is beneficial, pete rock is the issue
and i know you know my style is official
i might give a scratch (yes, cousin)
or i might kick a verse (no question)
either one, i can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
and if you want to stick around, i'll show you what i mean
not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
but, it's time to get wreck with the creator

it's time to get wreck with the creator

How to Rob (feat. The Madd Rapper)|50 Cent|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


yo, yo, yo, yo, you know who this is boy
the art of getting robbed
this is how we do brooklyn-style, boy, you know what i'm saying?
r.i.p b.i.g - nigga r.i.p p.a.c - r.i.p
enough of that shit, it's time to o.d, one time


the bottom line is i'm a crook with a deal
if my record don't sell i'mma rob and steal
you better recognize, nigga, i'm straight from the street
these industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
i'll snatch kim and tell puff, ''you want to see her again?
get your ass down to the nearest atm''
i have dreams of fucking an r&b bitch
but i wake up early and bounce with all her shit
when i apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
i'm about to stick bobby for some of that whitney money
brian mcknight, i can get that nigga anytime
have keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine
since these harlem world niggas seem to all be fam
i put the gun to cardan, tell him, ""tell your man""
mason betha, haha
come up off that watch now, i mean right now
the only excuse for being broke is being in jail
an entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
i'd rob odb, but that'd be a waste of time
probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
i'd follow fox in the drop for four blocks
plotting to jux her for that rock kurupt copped
what, jigga just sold like four milli, got something to live for
don't want a nigga putting four through that bentley coupe door
i'll manhandle case like ""dope, get on the ground
you ain't with mary no mo', where you getting chips from now?""
i been scheming on tone and poke since they found me
steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
i'm a klepto, nah for real, son, i'm sick
i'm bout to stick slick rick for all that old school shit
right now i'm bent and when i get like this i don't think
about to make stevie j take off that tight ass mink
i'll rob pun without a gun, snatch his piece then run
this nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gonna catch me, son?


this ain't serious
being broke can make you delirious
so we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger

i'll catch p and silkk the shocker right after the grammys
and will smith and jada ass down in miami
run up on timbaland and missy with the pound
like, ""you, give me the cash; you, put the hot dog down""
i figured it out, niggas been robbing joe before
that's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
my attitude while robbing j.d.? ""fuck you, pay me!""
had da brat with em, should've had his gat with him
dmx wanna get down, well, you tell, homie
i'm on that treach shit, i do my dirt all by my lonely
i should rob clue, man, his shit did well
i wanna stick tq, but his shit ain't sell
i hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave
catch rae, ghost, and rza for them funny ass rings
tell sticky give me the cash before i empty three
i'll beat your ass like that white boy on mtv
canibus wanna battle while i'm sticking him up
fuck the cab, the coroners picking 'em up
heavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga i saw you
he said ""why you robbing me? i got nothing but love for ya""
caught juvenile for his cash money piece
told him i want it all, he said, ""even my gold teeth?""
i caught blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
one at a time, get out and take off your shine
did you ever think that you would be this rich?
did you ever think that you would have these hits?
did you ever think that i'd flash the nine?
and walk off with your shit like it's mine?
i'mma keep sticking niggas until i'm living
i'll rob boyz ii men like i'm michael bivins
catch tyson for half that cash like robin givens
i'm hungry for real, i'm about to stick mister cee
that nigga still eating off big's first lp
i had busta and the whole flipmode on the floor
he asked me if i had enough, i told him, ""gimme some more""
is you feeling this? then wait for the sequel
i gotta get kirk franklin for robbing god's people


this ain't serious
being broke can make you delirious

for real, yo, you know what i'm saying?

i feel like a chip on my shoulders
i feel like i'm losin' my focus
i feel like i'm losin' my patience
i feel like my thoughts in the basement
feel like, i feel like you're miseducated
feel like i don't wanna be bothered
i feel like you may be the problem
i feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
the world is endin', i'm done pretendin'
and fuck you if you get offended
i feel like friends been overrated
i feel like the family been fakin'
i feel like the feelings are changin'
feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
feel like you wanna scrutinize how i made it
feel like i ain't feelin' you all
feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
i feel for you, i've been in the field for you
it's real for you, right? shit, i feel like—


ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me

i feel niggas been out of pocket
i feel niggas tappin' they pockets
i feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
i am legend, i feel like all of y'all is peasants
i feel like all of y'all is desperate
i feel like all it take is a second to feel like
mike jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
i ain't feelin' your presence
feel like i'ma learn you a lesson
feel like only me and the music though
i feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
i feel like the enemy you should know
feel like the feelin' of no hope
the feelin' of bad dope
a quarter ounce manipulated from soap
the feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
i'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
i feel like it's just me
look, i feel like i can't breathe
look, i feel like i can't sleep
look, i feel heartless, often off this
feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
darkest hours, lost it
fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
fill up the banks with dollars
fill up the graves with fathers
fill up the babies with bullshit
internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
i feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'pac was
the feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
but nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
the feelin' is toxic, i feel like i'm boxin' demons
monsters, false prophets schemin'
sponsors, industry promises
niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, compton
church, religion, token blacks in bondage
lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
fuck your feelings, i mean this for imposters
i can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
i can feel it, the dream is more than process
i can put a regime that forms a loch ness
i can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
i feel like sayin' somethin', i feel like takin' somethin'
i feel like skatin' off, i feel like waitin' for 'em
maybe it's too late for 'em
i feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
but who the fuck prayin' for me?

fuck that other shit, y'know what i'm sayin'?
we gonna do a lil somethin' like this
y'know what i'm sayin'?

keep it on and on and on and on and
know'm sayin'? big nas, grand wizard, what is it?
(it's like…) haha, you know what i'm sayin'?
yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!


i rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners
hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then i be dissin' a
unofficial that smoke woolie thai
i dropped out of cooley high, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er
my man put the battery in my back, a difference from energizer
sentence begins indented with formality
my duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
i drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
i reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
it's real, grew up in trife life, the times of white lines
the high pipes, murderous night times
and knife fights invite crimes
chill on the block with cognac, hold strap
with my peeps that's into drug money market interact
no sign of the beast in the blue chrysler
i guess that means peace
for niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
with side-bets, i roll a deuce, nothin' below
(peace god!) peace god – now the shit is explained
i'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
it's like that, y'all…


""now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""comin' outta queensbridge""
""now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""comin' outta queensbridge""
""now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""comin' outta queensbridge""
""now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""comin' outta queensbridge""


one for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
three for alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
i rap divine, god, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
my window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
live amongst no roses, only the drama
for real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
you're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 i let blow
and back down po-po when i'm vexed so
my pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
i see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
my intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
i'll reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
word to christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
i decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""peace""
i hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
they spoke of fat cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
some fiends scream about supreme team, a jamaica queens thing
uptown was alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
yo, fuck, rap is real! watch the herbs stand still
never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
true in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
i pour my heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane


""now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""comin' outta queensbridge""
""now let me take a trip down memory lane""

how i keep from goin' under?
it's like a jungle outside
sometimes i wonder how i keep from goin' under


we scream, ""black lives matter,"" but we still toting ladders
watching our own brothers trying to get at us
dreams get shattered when a scene full of crackers
and they charge you with some shit you ain't do
you like, ""what happened?""
we go get lawyers to say shit, we don't know how to talk
they told us to hate each other before we learn how to walk
mama taught you how to fight, fight, before she taught you how to write, right
and daddy locked down in the cell, can't kiss you night, night
monsters under the bed every night, feel like it's fright night
coke fumes in the air, mama holding on that pipe tight
and you catchin' contact, but never mind that
in a world where black is wrong and white right, it's like a combat
we go to war for our freedom, they say we equal
i used to wanna play like randall and be an eagle
i used to play the quarterback, my dog would go receiver
that was 'til the ball got flat by a dope needle on the pavement
it's amazin', this environment we was raised in
on them papers, one mistake and i'm gettin' caged in
you gotta feel me, feel like the system tryna kill me
got arrested and the charges f1 for popping wheelies, stay woke


it was designed for us to fail
we still prevail through the hell
yeah, can you believe it? we're still undefeated
though it was designed for us to lose
we'll still make it through, nothing's impossible
can you believe it? we're still undefeated


picture me ten years younger with some tats on my face
takin' a bunch of xannys with the strap on my waist
pointin' it at the camera like mama ain't teach me manners
tryna see mo' bills like i'm headed to alabama, no, wait
i can't judge them, i'm just trying to understand them
'cause i used to pop percs, pourin' purple in my fanta
had me swerving in my phantom like i'm runnin' from my dreams
i was headed for the slammer, i was plantin' all the seed
for them to bury me, i had my whole family mad at me
fell deep in love with the game and it married me
judge said, ""i'll give you a chance, just don't embarrass me""
motivatin' these little niggas is like a charity
community service even though they knew we was workin'
they did this to me on purpose, 'cause i ain't movin' too perfect
i stay away from them clowns, watch how i move through the circus
'cause they be weighing you down, even some of them dudes in your circle, stay woke


though it's designed for us to fail, yeah
we still prevail through the hell, yeah
can you believe it? we're still undefeated
though it was designed for us to lose
nothing, nothing, nothing's impossible, no
can you believe it? we're still undefeated


how can i pledge allegiance to the flag
when they killin' all our sons, all our dads?
i come from a place, when you kill your own brother you can brag
like he got bodies, but that's a fad, no, that's a fact
i'm screamin' out at your corner, nigga, that's a trap
screamin' out at your homie, nigga, that's a rat
catch a case with him, bet he crack
the odds against you and they double stacked, stay woke
bought my mom a new crib, that's some gangster shit
niece and nephews walking around wearing minks and shit
kept the hood motivated, this the thanks i get?
try to ja rule the kid on some wanksta shit
but that's impossible 'cause i'm unstoppable
the label can't drop me, nigga, i'm too valuable
you thought i would lose but i won and that bothered you
still movin' 'round in philly just like the mobsters do
when i talked to em and hov, they said, ""i'm proud of you
you stood tall back when everyone doubted you""
my reply is, ""i did what i gotta do
and i need that verse 'fore you retire too""
jumping all the obstacles, i'm way too wavy
said i would lose boy you way too crazy
pick and choose either fame or the money, fame will make you crazy
and the money will make them bad bitches say, ""thank you, baby""
you're welcome"

we gon' put it in reverse


darling, i told you many times
and i am telling you once again
just to remind you, sweetheart
that my—


oh, lamar
hail mary and marijuana, times is hard
pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives, i'm a star
life is one funny mothafucka
a true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
i might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
see, once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
well-respected, calm and collected
laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, momma on crack
a four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
his family history: pimpin' and bangin'
he was meant to be dangerous
clocked him a grip and start slangin'
fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters
caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
but witnesses couldn't prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin'
bird-shufflin', anthony rang
the first in the projects with the two-tone mustang
that 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
circlin' parking lots and parking spots
and hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it
he brushed 'em off and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken
see, at this chicken spot
there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth
he worked the window, his name was ducky
he came from the streets, the robert taylor homes
southside projects, chiraq, the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and 500 dollars
they had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
cadillac seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'cross the street from the projects, anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before, back in '84
that's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
so many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
prevalent proposition with 9's
ducky was well-aware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
free chicken every time anthony posted in line
two extra biscuits, anthony liked him and then let him slide
they didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma, and i'll tell you why
you take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
because if anthony killed ducky, top dawg could be servin' life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight



so, i was takin' a walk the other day…"

and even when i was close to defeat, i rose to my feet
my life's like a soundtrack i wrote to the beat
treat rap like cali weed: i smoke 'til i sleep
wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
i bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
it's not a fluke, it's been tried, i'm the truth
since ""turn off the lights"" from the world class wreckin cru
i'm still at it, after mathematics
in the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

It's Tricky|Run–D.M.C.|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
this speech is my recital, i think it's very vital
to rock (a rhyme), that's right (on time)
""it's tricky"" is the title, here we go...


it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... it's tricky (tricky) tricky (tricky)
it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... tr-tr-tr-tricky (tricky) trrrrrrrrrrricky


i met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
went to her house and bust her out, i had to leave real early
these girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
or spend some time and rock a rhyme, i said ""it's not that easy""


it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... (how is it d?) it's tricky (tricky) tricky (trrrrrricky)
it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... tricky (tricky) tricky


in new york the people talk and try to make us rhyme
they really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time
and in the city it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside


it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... (how is it d?) tricky (tricky) tricky (tricky)
it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... tricky (tricky) tricky (tricky) huh!


when i wake up people take up mostly all of my time
i'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cause i make up a rhyme
i'm not braggin', people naggin' cause they think i'm a star
always tearin' what i'm wearin', i think they're goin' too far
a girl named carol follows darryl every gig we play
then d dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' jay
i ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cause i'm on tv
they even bother my poor father cause he's down with me


it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... (how is it?) tricky (tricky) tricky (tricky)
it's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
it's tricky... tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (tr-tr-tr-tricky) tr-tr-tr...


we are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)
they offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone
it's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit
you keep on (rock!) shock 'cause this is it..."

but still i find the time to put that bump off in your eye
total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
we takin' another route to represent the dungeon family
like great day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
we stabbin' every city then we headed to that bat cave
atl, georgia, what do we do for ya?
bulldoggin' hoes like them georgetown hoyas
boy, you sounding silly, think my brougham ain't sittin' pretty
doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
damn, we, the committee, gon' burn it down
but us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now, say


ah ha, hush that fuss
everybody move to the back of the bus
do you wanna bump and slump with us?

i met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
to stimulate then activate the left and right brain
said, ""baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
you focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'""
that's one to live by or either that's one to die to
i try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
andré, got to her station, here's my destination
she got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head
for hours, took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group
ain't comin' with it, but i'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it
anyway, but anyhow, when in doubt
went on out and bought it 'cause i thought it would be jammin'
but examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully
sad and it's costly, but that's all she
wrote and i hope i never have to float in that boat
up shit's creek, ""it's weak"" is the last quote
that i wanna hear when i'm goin' down
when all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
when the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
all y'all can say is, ""them niggas earned that crown"", but until then


ah ha, hush that fuss
everybody move to the back of the bus
do you wanna bump and slump with us?
we the type of people make the club get crunk
say ah ha, hush that fuss

and tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
and i'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide

your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, i assassin my casualty

The Ghetto|Too $hort|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
talking bout the ghetto...funky, funky ghetto
trying to survive, trying to stay alive


the ghetto
the ghetto
(talking bout the ghetto)
the ghetto
the ghetto
(funky, funky ghetto)


even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth
old school buddies not doing it right
every day it's the same and it's the same every night
i wouldn't shoot you bro but i'd shoot that fool
if he played me close and tried to test my cool
every day i wonder just how i'll die
only thing i know is how to survive
there's only one rule in the real world
and that's to take care of you, only you and yours
keep dealing with the hard times day after day
might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
black man trying to break into my house again
thought he got off dope doing time in the pen
even though my brothers do me just like that
i get a lot of love so i'm giving it back to the ghetto


the ghetto
(talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
the ghetto
(funky, funky ghetto)
the ghetto
(trying to live our lives)
the ghetto
(won't ya tell 'em 'bout it too $hort)


so just peep the game and don't call it crap
'cause to me, life is one hard rap
even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
she was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
and her baby died just like a dope fiend
the story i tell is so incomplete
five kids in the house, no food to eat
don't look at me and don't ask me why
mama's next door getting high
even though she's got five mouths to feed
she'd rather spend her money on a h-i-t
i always tell the truth about things like this
i wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
instead of adding to the task force send some help
waiting on him i'd better help myself
housing authority and the o.p.d
all these guns just to handle me in the ghetto...


the ghetto
(people are dyin')
the ghetto
(children are cryin')
the ghetto
(don't have enough to eat)
the ghetto
(don't even have shoes on their feet)
the ghetto


even though they put us down and call us animals
we make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
drive fancy cars, make love to stars
never really saying just who we are
we use alias names like too $hort
sell you stuff you might kill for
young kids grow up and that's all they know
didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
only thing he knows is how to survive
but will he kill another brother before he dies?
in the ghetto, you keep one eye open
all day long, just hoping and hoping
you can pay your bills and not drink too much
then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
like me, but you don't see
ten years from now, where will you be?


the ghetto
(tryin' to get out of the ghetto)
the ghetto
(but i got no place to go)
the ghetto
(tryin' to survive in the heart of the ghetto)
the ghetto
(ha, 'cause that's the only place that i know)


so much game in a too $hort rap
can't be white and whites can't be black
why you wanna act like someone else?
all you gotta do is just be yourself
we're all the same color underneath
short dog is in the house, you better listen to me
never be ashamed of what you are
proud to be black, stand tall and hard
even though some people give you no respect
be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
and when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
so if you don't listen, it's not my fault
i'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost
sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
while me and my people try to get out

Regulate|Warren G|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


regulators. we regulate any stealin' of his property. we’re damn good too. but you can’t be any geek off the street. you gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what i mean. earn your keep. regulators, mount up!


it was a clear black night, a clear white moon
warren g was on the streets tryin' to consume
some skirts for the eve so i can get some phones
rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone


just hit the east side of the lbc
on a mission tryin' to find mr. warren g
seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
all you skirts know what's up with 213


so i hooks a left on 21 and lewis
some brothers shootin' dice, so i said ""let's do this!""
i jumped out the ride and said ""what's up?""
some brothers pulled some gats, so i said ""i'm stuck!""


since these girls peepin' me i'ma glide and swerve
these hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
i see my homie and some suckas all in his mix


i'm gettin' jacked, i'm breakin' myself
i can't believe they takin' warren's wealth
they took my rings, they took my rolex
i looked at the brother, said ""damn, what's next?""


they got my homie hemmed up and they all around
can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
they wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
i best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down


they got guns to my head, i think i'm goin' down
i can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
if i had wings i would fly, let me contemplate
i glanced in the cut and i see my homie nate


sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
nate dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
nate dogg and warren g had to regulate




i laid all them bustas down, i let my gat explode
now i'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
if you want skirts, sit back and observe
i just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb


now, nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
before i got jacked i was on the same track
back up, back up, ‘cause it's on
n-a-t-e and me, the warren to the g


just like i thought, they were in the same spot
in need of some desperate help
but nate dogg and the g child
were in need of somethin' else
one of them dames was sexy as hell
i said ""ooh, i like your size!""
she said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice
would you let me ride?""
i got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
the next stop is the eastside motel




i'm tweaking into a whole new era
g-funk, step to this, i dare ya
funk on a whole new level


the rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble


chords, strings, we brings melody
g-funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm


if you know like i know
you don't wanna step to this
it's the g-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
if you smoke like i smoke
then you're high like everyday
and if yo' ass is a busta, 213 will regulate"

so i'd advise you not to trust that ho
silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
knowing damn well i'm too caught up with my grip
now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
how many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named snoop
doggy, i'm all the above
i'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
but see it ain't no fun
if my homies can't get a taste of it
cause you know i don't love em


woo! hey, now you know
inhale, exhale with my flow
one for the money, two for the bitches
three to get ready and four to hit the switches
in my chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
with bitches on my side and bitches on my back
so back up, bitch, because i'm struggling
just get on your knees and then start juggling
these motherfucking nuts in your mouth
it's me, warren g the nigga with the clout


it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none"

Mona Lisa (feat. Kendrick Lamar)|Lil Wayne|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
я хочу рассказать тебе историю
ты знаешь, я дорожу тобой
надеюсь, в ней не слишком много чувств


я вижу ниггеров в этой сучке, опустошающих бутылку за бутылкой
напиваются с этими сучками
и когда они уходят, за ними следуют
засыпают с этой сучкой, ничего о ней не зная
затем она впускает нас, мы забираем все твоё дерьмо
и когда ты просыпаешься, она помогает тебе попытаться найти это, я люблю это


я зависаю с сучками, которые зависают с сучками
которые зависают с богатыми ниггерами
я говорю ей: «возьми их», она говорит: «у меня уже есть ты»
я говорю: «нет, сучка, возьми его»
и они такие милые, и у них длинные волосы
он напился и спит на её сиськах
затем она подаёт нам сигнал, мы входим с ак
""это ограбление!"" она кричит, словно жертва
теперь ты чувствуешь себя так глупо
я курю траву, мне так кайфово, словно я ceelie
ссыкун дрожит, что ты там сказал?
следи за языком, милли ванилли
ты можешь быть подставлен, ты можешь быть обманут
сучкой, к которой у тебя есть чувства
потому что ты думал, что она ангел
но эта сучка - не ангел, я использую её нимб вместо фрисби
и ты рассказываешь про свои дела - она передаёт это мне
ты рассказываешь этой суке о своих чувствах
она вливала тебе в уши сладкую ложь
ложь текла даже сквозь её зубы
она знает, где тебе спрятаться, чтобы рассказать мне, где ты спрятался
она знает, когда тебе стоит уйти, чтобы рассказать мне, когда приходить
мы врываемся в твой дом и забираем всё
пока сучка на отдыхе с ним
так что её не обвиняют, мы не цепляемся
мы узнаем адреса и не оставляем беспорядка
ты заметишь пропажу только когда начнёшь искать её
и подумаешь, что стоит ещё подумать
она спросит тебя: ""что-то не так?"", ты ответишь: ""ничего, отдыхай""
она спросит: ""что пропало?"", ты ответишь: ""откуда ты узнала, что что-то пропало?""
он почешет голову, она скажет: ""возвращайся в постель""
и сделает ему минет. чувак, не доверяй сукам
и она сказала: ""ооо...""


я вижу ниггеров в этой сучке, опустошающих бутылку за бутылкой
напиваются с этими сучками
и когда они уходят, за ними следуют
i be with bitches that know the bitches
that's with the niggas we followin’
get them on the line, stay two cars behind
and tell them hoes, ""don't be so obvious!""
mona lisa, long hair, don't care
she handle the business and don’t ever tell
she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
she tell 'em, ""ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!""
and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
she feed him lies with his silverware
she don't want love, she just want her share


i know a bitch named liz
this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
so he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
and then she tell me and i be all ears
and then i go and tell my people and they already know him
and then i call liz and she say he comin' over
i say, ""good girl, just remember what i told ya""
she gave me the salute, i say, ""girl, you're a soldier""
we're waitin’ outside, watch him pull up
walk up to the door and right before he knock
she open the door naked, she left it unlocked
they started french kissin’ so he didn't see moi
and then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
music up loud with his head in the clouds
turn that shit down and i scared the piss out of him
piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
nigga, turn around, i ain’t here to fuck around
i ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
you know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
liz, that’s enough, you can put your hands down
and then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
she a good actress and you a dead actor
you'll be dead after we get what we're after
if liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
i got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
but think for me, nigga
send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
i hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
she pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
mona lisa, i done painted the picture
mo-mona lisa, out the frame on these niggas
pussy got you out of character, nigga
you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
we have your attention
and now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
we just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (uh)


ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
chillin' with the laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
four minute on the clock, black mamba with the ball
paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
probably on a internet blog
in a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
mona lisa
pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
and he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against god
poetry in a pear tree
sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
woke up in the morning to the great gatsby
then he dogged it again like the bitch lassie
i'm a dog in the wind, i'm a pit laughing
i'ma call up again like i did last week
make good with the friend and i'm all jazzy
britney with the twin and the girl ashley
found out that i fucked, he was unhappy
bitch, i never let the bullshit get past me
better yet, i wanna break up, don't you ask me
'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
but you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (no!)
you fuckin' with wayne's? (no!)
bitch, gimme your phone! (no!)
let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) he on your fuckin' ringtone?
is that the shit that you do?
touchin' yourself, lookin' at kendrick videos
jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
i don't know what the fuck lately got into you
tell me who love you, i bet i love harder
forgot all the shit that i did for your daughter?
the pampers, the pedialyte and my momma
daycare after school and she never did charge her
you scandalous as fuck and i hope you blow up
you know what, i give up, let me go get my gun
i got one in the chamber i'm plannin' on aimin'
goddammit, you know that the damage is done
bitch i'm emotional 'cause i'm in stress
i'm not supposed to go through this, i guess
so in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
i'm killin' myself


she say, ooh, daddy, ooh, mona lisa, mona lisa
ooh, fake smile, mona lisa, mona lisa
she say, ooh, no emotion, mona lisa, mona lisa
now he get the picture, mona lisa, mona lisa, yeah"

Passin' Me By|The Pharcyde|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


now in my younger days i used to sport a shag
when i went to school i carried lunch in a bag
with an apple for my teacher cause i knew i'd get a kiss
always got mad when the class was dismissed
but when it was in session, i always had a question
i would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
help me with my problem, it was never much
just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
oh, how i wish i could hold her hand and give her a hug
she was married to the man, he was a thug
his name was lee, he drove a z
he'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
i was on her jock, yes indeedy i wrote graffiti on the bus
first i'd write her name then carve a plus
with my name last, on the looking glass
i seen her yesterday but still i had to let her pass


she keeps on passing me by
she keeps on passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
she keeps on passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
she keeps on pa--


when i dream of fairytales i think of me and shelly
see she's my type of hype and i can't stand when brothers tell me
that i should quit chasin' and look for something better
but the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
i haven't gone as far as asking if i could get with her
i just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
i'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
she could be my broad, and i could be her nigga
but, all i can do was stare
back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
not at all overrated, i think i need a prayer
to get in her book and it looks rather dry
i guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
although she's crazy stepping, i'll try to stop her stride
'cause i won't have no more of this passing me by


time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
she was kind of like a star, thinking i was like a fan
damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man
he was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
she told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
she was a flake like corn, and i was born not to understand
by letting her pass i had proved to be a better man


she keeps on passing me by
she keeps on passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
she keeps on passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
she keeps on passing me


now there she goes again, the dopest ethiopian
and now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much i try?
wait, no, i did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
and i was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
from a distance i desired her, secretly admired her
wired her a letter to get her, and it went
my dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but i know you very well
now let me tell you about the feelings i have for you
when i try or make some sort of attempt, i symp
damn i wish i wasn't such a wimp
cause then i would let you know that i love you so
and if i was your man then i would be true
the only lying i would do is in the bed with you
then i signed sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, ps love me tender
the letter came back three days later: return to sender, damn


she keeps on passing me by
she keeps on passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
she keeps on passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
she keeps on passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
she keeps on pa--
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
passing me by
(nevertheless, i'll say it again)
(nevertheless)

she keeps on passing me by

before we get the four pounders and take their face off
the streets is filled with undercovers
homicide chasing brothers
the d's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
and killer coppers even come through in helicopters
i drink a little vodka, spark a l and hold a glock
for the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
thinking it can't happen 'til i trap 'em and clap 'em
and leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
i don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards

sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
will go on, as i perform
transformin on stage like a decepticon
but i'm not animated like a cartoon
i'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
so let's groove with the smooth operator


""cause i'm so smooth...""

the b-i-g, d-a-double-d-y-k-a-n-e
i'm good and plenty, servin many and any
competition, wishin' for an expedition
i'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
rappers act so wild, and love to profile
frontin hard but ain't got no style
i give nightmares to those who compete
freddy kreuger, walkin' on kane street
confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
destruction from the exterminator
but in a calm manner, cause i'm a smooth operator


""cause i'm so smooth...""


now girls step up to this
one simple kiss, and it's over, miss
sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
so just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
cause it's a big daddy thing
and i'm lovin em right, word is bond
so just play marvin gaye and let's get it on
i make it real good like dr. feelgood
to make sure that my point is understood
that when it comes to this there's none greater
sincerely yours... the smooth operator


""cause i'm so smooth...""


now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
sayin' i'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
the smooth way i say 'em and the way i display 'em
to make them sound different in a way that's gifted
and hey i'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
and i make one line, bright as the sunshine
attack you like robitussin on a cough
if you know like i know -- step off
competition, i'mma get rid of
you can't get a bit of, so just consider
a break or rest, vacation, hibernation
and make way for my smooth operation
i'm a smooth operator


""cause i'm so smooth...""

ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
genuine for '89
and i still ain't half-steppin, peace!"

this is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
had to give you a career to destroy it
lethal injection
go to sleep six feet deep, i'll give you a b for the effort

you'd look up to me, and for the record
you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
lick a ballsack to get on my channel

who else want it? kells—attempt fails! budden—l's!
fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as cottonelle
killshot, i will not fail, i'm with the doc still
but this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
but, kells, the day you put out a hit's the day diddy admits
that he put the hit out that got pac killed, ah!
i'm sick of you bein' wack
and still usin' that mothafuckin' auto-tune
so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
i'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
need to get the cock up out it
before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
i'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
that you're marshall mathers (marshall mathers)
don't mean you are, and you're not about it
so just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

Just a Friend|Biz Markie|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
but a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
let me tell ya a story of my situation
i was talkin' to this girl from the u.s. nation
the way that i met her was on tour, at a concert
she had long hair and a short miniskirt
i just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
i was walkin' through the crowd and guess who i met
i whispered in her ear, ""come to the picture booth
so i can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
i asked her her name, she said: ""blah-blah-blah""
she had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
i took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
i said: ""how do you like the show?"" she said: ""i was very amused""
i started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
but when i sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
then when i asked, ""do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
she said: ""no, i don't, i only have a friend""
come on!
i'm not even goin' for it, this is what i'm goin' sing


you, you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
and you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend


so i took blah-blah's word for it at this time
i thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'cause i have friends and that's a fact
like agnes, agatha, germaine, and jack
forget about that, let's go into the story
about a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
so we started talkin', gettin' familiar
spendin' a lot of time, so we can build up
a relationship or some understanding
how it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
everything sounded so dandy and sweet
i had no idea i was in for a treat
after this was established, everything was cool
the tour was over and she went back to school
i called every day to see how she was doin'
every time that i called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
i called her room, a guy picked up, but then i called again
i say: ""yo, who was that?"" ""oh, he's just a friend""
don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
jus' bust this


you, you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
and you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend


so, i came to her college on a surprise visit
to see my girl, that was so exquisite
it was a school day, i knew she was there
the first semester of the school year
i went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
this guy made me fill out a visitor's form
he told me where it was and i was on my way
to see my baby doll, i was happy to say
i arrived in front of the dormitory
""yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
they showed me where it was for the moment
i didn't know i was in for such an event
so, i came to her room and opened the door
oh, snap! guess what i saw?
a fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
i was so in shock, my heart went down south
so please, listen to the message that i send
don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend..."

i can't respect you niggas
i am the golden child, they gettin' older now
it would make sense why you boys get no recognition
they want me dead or alive
someone tell mom i won't see 25
mean, i can tell her but i just do not want to be there to witness the tears in her eyes
'cuzzi been back on the road
'cuzzi still stuck in the cold
i've been second guessin' like there's someone better than me in my city? (wait)


no, no, no! they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life
they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life


niggas look like virgins
washed up on the tide, that's detergent
hm, i feel like ja' back in '99
niggas see me scream, ""murder""
i walk around and scream, ""murder""
nowadays, everybody getting murdered
the judge asked for the verdict
then he looked at the jury


no, no, no! they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life
they want me dead or alive
they want me dead or alive, i'm just tryin' to survive
you niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
put that shit on my life"

growin' up, my mama explained the difference between fame and notoriety
see fame is when people know you
notoriety is when people know your work

some will hate, some will cheer
all will know one thing
my nigga nut, we came and changed the music game forever

tippy?
all my people 
hey, uh

fly robin fly...fly robin fly...fly robin fly
up, up to the sky


excuse me as i kiss the sky
sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful a rye
who the fuck wanna die for their culture
stalk the dead body like a vulture
ticallion, hmmm
blacker than your blackest stallion
hit your housing projects
i represent yo shaolin my nigga
hell yes, apocalypse now, the gun blaow
it be goin down, diggy diggy down, diggy down down


while the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
when i raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck
'cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore
raw to the floor, raw like reservoir dogs
the green-eyed bandit can't stand it
with more fruitier loops then that toucan sam bitch
plus, the bombazee got me wide...
(messin' with them) is a straight suicide




10 9 8 7 6 5 4

tical bring it to that ass raw
breaking all the rules like glass jaws
nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
fucka, we don't need no rap tour
i'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
more than you bargained for
tical, that stays open like an all night store
for real, i keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
and end your existence, m-e-t
ain't no use for resistance, h-o-d


i shift like a clutch with the ruck
examine my nuts, i don't stop 'til i get enough
6 million ways to die, so i chose
made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
the blindfold, cold, so you can feel the wrath
and shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
ayo my man (tical) hit me now
bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
forget me not, i rock the spot, check glock
empty off a lickin off in hip hop
fuck the billboard, i'm a bullet on my block
how you dope when you paid for your billboard spot?


look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(it's the funk doctor spock smokin' buddah on the train)
how high? (so high that i can kiss the sky)
how sick? (so sick that you can suck my dick)

(look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)
recognize johnny blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
(how high?) so high that i can kiss the sky
(how sick?) so sick that you can suck my dick


as i run a mile with a racist
my style was born in the pissy staircases
dig it, eff a rap critic
he talk about it while i live it
if red got the blunt, i'm the second one to hit it


look up in the, i got the verbs, nouns and glocks in ya
enter the center, lyrics bang like rico-chet rabbit
i bring havoc with an a-k matic
rollin blunts an all day habit
i get it on like smiff and wess
who click's the best?
punks take a sip and test
who splits your vest?
the funk phenomenon
i'm bombin' you like lebanon
flow canals of panama just off stamina

roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
all eyes on me
all eyes on me
but you know what?


i bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
so many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
say they ready for the funk, but i don't think they knowin'
straight to the depths of hell is where them cowards goin'
well, are you still down? nigga, holla when you see me
and let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
i got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
until i die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when i'm high
fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all i want is cash and thangs
a five-double-oh benz, flauntin' flashy rings
uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
it seems, my main thing was to be major paid
the game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
one nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
depend on me like the first and fifteenth
they might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
we got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
screamin', ""thug life"" every time they pass, all eyes on me


live the life of a thug nigga until the day i die
live the life of a boss player (all eyes on me) 'cause even gettin' high

hey, to my nigga 'pac


so much trouble in the world, nigga
can't nobody feel your pain
the world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
my girl said i need a raise, how long will she last?
i'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as i dip
i'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
needy hookers got a lot of nerve
let my bucket swerve, i'm takin' off from the curb
the nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
devoted to servin' this moët and pay checks
like akai satellite, nigga, i'm forever ballin'
it ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
my devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
where you goin', i been there, came back as lonely, homie
steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
it's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
it ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
what can i do? what can i say? is there another way?
blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
my little homie g, can't you see i'm buster-free?
niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me


live the life of a thug nigga until the day i die
live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high

all eyes on me


the feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
will i survive? will i die? come on, let's picture the possibility
givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
i told the judge i was raised wrong and that's why i blaze shit
was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
on my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
bitches, i fuck with a passion, i'm livin' rough and raw
catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
live my life as a thug nigga until the day i die
live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
these niggas got me tossin' shit
i put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
up in the benz, burnin' rubber
the money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
this criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me


live the life of a thug nigga until the day i die
live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
all eyes on me
all eyes on me
live the life of a thug nigga until the day i die
live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high

and i'ma get mad deep like a threat
blow up your project, then take all your assets

hit you with 16 shots and more, i got
goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh


it's the method man, for short mr. mef
movin' on your left, uh!

i wanna break, fool, cock me back
small change, they puttin' shame in the game
i take aim and blow the nigga out the frame

but i do, true, can i get a ""suuu""?
nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh

first things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
i'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
i'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
shame on you when you step through to
the ol' dirty bastard straight from the brooklyn zu
and i'll be damned if i let any man
come to my center, you enter the winter
straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
you can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
the ol' dirty bastard is dirty and stinkin'
ason unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
bite my style, i'll bite your motherfuckin' ass


for cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
not long is how long that this rhyme took me
ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
there's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
i love gats; if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
i come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stompin' grounds
i give an order to my peeps across the water
to go and snatch up props all around the border
and get far like a shootin' star
'cause who i are is livin' the life of pablo escobar
point-blank as i kick the square biz
there it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes


yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
it's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
feelin' mad hostile, wearin' aéropostale
flowin' like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
with the buck-us style, the ruckus
ten times ten men committin' mad sin
turn the other cheek and i'll break your fuckin' chin
slayin' boom-bangs like african drums
(he'll be) comin' around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
my clan increase like black unemployment
yeah, another one dare
jih-jigga-genius; take us the fuck outta here


the wu is too slammin' for these cold killin' labels
some ain't had hits since i seen aunt mabel
be doin' artists in like cain did abel
now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
that's what you get when you misuse what i invent
your empire falls and you lose every cent
for tryna blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
should've pumped it when i rocked it
niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors, they're scared to death to pump these
first of all, who's your a&r?
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
but he don't know the meanin' of dope
when he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
and i'm the dirtiest thing in sight

The Real Slim Shady|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
may i have your attention, please?
may i have your attention, please?
will the real slim shady please stand up?
i repeat, will the real slim shady please stand up?
we're gonna have a problem here...


y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)
it's the return of the ""ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?""
and dr. dre said… nothing, you idiots!
dr. dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
feminist women love eminem
""chicka, chicka, chicka, slim shady, i'm sick of him
look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""yeah, but he's so cute though.""
yeah, i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't, but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
""my bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
and if i'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel, don't they?
we ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel, i got the antidote
women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—


i'm slim shady, yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?


will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (nope)
well, i do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
you think i give a damn about a grammy?
half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
so you can sit me here next to britney spears?
shit, christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
""yeah, he's cute, but i think he's married to kim, hee-hee.""
i should download her audio in mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd (agh!)
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me, so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me


'cause i'm slim shady, yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?


i'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it, i just shit it
better than 90% of you rappers out can
then you wonder: ""how can
kids eat up these albums like valiums?""
it's funny, ‘cause at the rate, i'm going, when i'm 30
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking, but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king, spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""i don't give a fuck!""
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up?
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?


i'm slim shady, yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes i'm the real shady

so won't the real slim shady please stand up

the shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
people said his brain was infected by devils
my father would come home, he would forget about the killings
he wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him
maybe that was the problem
then, one night, the shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
they were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
that was the night everything changed


see, sometimes
you gotta flash 'em back
see niggas don't know where this shit started
y'all know where it came from
i'm saying we gonna take y'all back to the source
do the knowledge, yo


when the mcs came to live out the name and to perform
some had to snort cocaine to act insane before pete rocked it on
now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
yo, rza, flip the track with the what to cut


fake niggas get flipped
in mic fights i swing swords and cut clowns
shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
i flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
on some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
but it was your op to shop stolen art
catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
i put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
that's minimum, and feminine like sandals
my minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
energy is felt once the cards are dealt
with the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
that attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
i represent from midnight to high noon
i don't waste ink, nigga, i think
i drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
only under one circumstance that's if i'm blunted
turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it


now when the mcs came to live out the name and to perform
some had to snort cocaine to act insane before pete rocked it on
now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
yo, rza, flip the track with the what to cut


i'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
but when i swing my swords they all choppable
i be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
child educator, plus head amputator
'cause niggas styles are old like mark 5 sneakers
lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
don't even stop in my station and attack
while your plan failed, get derailed like amtrak
what the fuck for? down by law, i make law
i be justice, i sentence that ass two to four
round the clock, that state pen time, check it
but the pens i be sticking with, you can't state the crime
came through with the wu, slid off on the dl
i'm low-key like seashells, i rock these bells
now come aboard, it's medina bound
enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
it's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
so deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin


when the mcs came to live out the name and to perform
some had to snort cocaine to act insane before pete rocked it on
now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
yo, rza, flip the track with the what to cut"

i got the drink in me going back to back
yeah, going back to back
i got the drink in me going back to back
yeah, i'm going back to back
i don't wanna hear about this ever again
not even when she tell him that they better as friends
not even when you saying, ""drizzy, tell 'em again!""
i been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
oh, you need better seatin'
i didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
the point i'm tryin' to make is i don't ever need 'em
seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
please, please do not let these niggas near me
please, think before you come for the great one
please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
please, somebody stop me
i'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
i got the fest in five days and it's my shit
soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
they gon' ask if i can play this shit back to back
yeah, they want it back to back
they gon' ask if i can play this shit back to back
i took a break from views, now it's back to that, nigga (six)"

What's The Difference|Dr. Dre|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


what's the difference between me and you?
what's the difference between me and you?


back when cube was rollin' with lorenzo in a benzo
i was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
got the pens and pencils, got down to business
but sometimes the business end of this shit
can turn your friends against you
but you was a real nigga, i could sense it in you
i still remember the window of the car that you went through
that's fucked up, but i'll never forget the shit we been through
and i'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'cause you my nigga, doc, and eazy, i'm still with you
fuck the beef, nigga, i miss you
and that's just being real with you
you see the truth is
everybody wanna know how close me and snoop is
and who i'm still cool with
then i got these fake-ass niggas i first blew with
claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they
(do not resist the beat)
spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
move units, then talk shit and we can do this
until then, i ain't even speakin' your name
just keep my name outta your mouth
and we can keep it the same, nigga
it ain't that i'm too big to listen to the rumors
it's just that i'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
that's the difference


what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
what's the difference between me and you?

yo, i stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
never knew about the next level until dre did it
i stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
i smash you critics like a overhand right from riddick
come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
i be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
so what the fuck am i supposed to do?
i pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
a heartless bastard, high and plastered
my style is like the reaction from too much acid
never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
hang hollywood niggas by they soul train laminates
what's the difference between me and you? (what?)
about five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
until my death, i'm bangladesh
i suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
yo, that's the difference!

stop the beat a minute, i got somethin' to say, dre
i wanna tell you this shit right now
while this fuckin' weed is in me (what the fuck?)
i don't know if i ever told you this
but i love you, dog, i got your motherfuckin' back
(right) just know this shit
slim, i don't know if you noticed it
but i've had your back from day one,
nigga, let's blow this bitch
i mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed:
""whose throat is it?""
well if you ever kill that kim bitch
i'll show you where the ocean is
well, that's cool, and i appreciate the offer
but if i do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
i'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
and cruise around with her for seven hours through california
and have her wavin' at people (hi!)
then drop her off on the corner at the police station
and drive off honkin' the horn for her
raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
drop the sawed off
and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
fuck blood, i wanna see some lungs coughed up
get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
in they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
that's for tryin' to talk like the chronic was lost product
that's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
you better show some respect whenever the doc's brought up
so what's the difference between us? we can start at the penis
or we can scream ""i just don't give a fuck"" and see who means it


what's the difference between me and you?
you talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
i act on what i feel and never deal with emotions
i'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

and in the morning it's girls
'cause in the evening it's girls

i like the way that they walk
and it's chill to hear them talk
and i can always make them smile

back in the day
there was this girl around the way
she liked my home-piece mca
he said he would not give her play
i asked him, ""please?"" – he said, ""you may.""
her pants were tight and that's ok
if she would dance, i would dj
we took a walk down to the bay

i hope she'll say
""hey, me and you should hit the hay!""
i asked her out, she said ""no way!""
i should've probably guessed her gay
so i broke north with no delay
i heard she moved real far away
that was two years ago this may
i seen her just the other day

every second, every minute
man, i swear that she can get it
say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
hands up high, hands up high
tell 'em dim the lights down right now
put me in the mood
i'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go


i recognize your fragrance
hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
uh, and i know your taste is
a little bit, hmm, high maintenance
uh, everybody else basic
you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
would you trust it?
i mean, i write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
better yet, where your friends and 'em?
i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off
fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends
and y'all curled in that little bitty range
i heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
nigga, don't approach her with that atari
nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
they say conversation rule a nation, i can tell
but i could never right my wrongs
'less i write it down for real, p.s


you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it

with all these seductive photographs
and all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
young east african girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
i was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
take you and your momma to the motherland
i could do it, maybe one day
when you figure out you're gonna need someone
when you figure out it's alright here in the city
and you don't run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
you were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
i mean, i write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin
and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
good god, what you doin' that walk for?
when i see that thing move
i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
they say communication save relations, i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs
unless i write 'em down for real, p.s


you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it

makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
i'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
would you trust it? i mean, you need to hear this
love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
call me crazy, we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
i mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
and i can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
i want that interference, it's coherent, i can hear it
uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, p.s


you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it

what's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
on my block, ya had to have that understanding
cause if ya told ms. mattie, she went and told gladys
and once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
and when the word got back, they set yo' ass on fire
on my block, we got some 'nam vets shell-shocked
who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks
on my block--it's like the world don't exist
we stay confined to this small little section we living in
oh my block, i wouldn't trade it for the world
cause i love these ghetto boys and girls
born and raised on my block


my block - where everything is everything for sheezy

in this rap shit, ain't no time for the dilly-dally
pally throw a match in the gasoline alley
blew up mad spots, kids was jealous for the props
see the shit never stops, hops, just looking for my dillz-knot
styles relate, never fake, broke breaks in every crate
old freestyles and dirty ass copied-over tapes
notify that; the artifacts never slack
while crews is on stage wack, we just play the back

i just wanna do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
but biters and backstabbin' rappers don't even like us
but props due, peep the source, rap pages and the billboard
and read about the tours while you be flappin' your jaws

niggas, can't believe the artifacts achieve
got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
so bring submission to the rap recognition
my right hand is itching from the shit that i'm scripting
so pass the baton, to the next runner up, tame
i give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down


aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, i drop bombs, but since
our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half-assed
watchin' others rock and clock we shocked 'em like a robot
with our props, so now the notty head niggas got more knots yo
my pockets are lumpy, chump, my drunk style is trunky
dunk my disc in crisp, put funk in funk like humpty hump
cuz i'm comin' from the underground i'm down wit da git down
mc's who used to diss us, get pissed 'cause they ain't shit now
the artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
the days of gettin' slept on, are dead because we keep on
peepin' these weak mc's, who cheese with their bologny
'cause they're phony as fuck, and couldn't pull shit off of tow trucks
so yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down
or c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

and bein' the baller that i am, i talk to them
givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
when they realize i ain't even ridin' dirty
bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
i'ma laugh at you and then i'll have to cruise
yeah, my number two on some old-school dj screw
you can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
this is a message to the law, tellin' them, ""we hate you""
i can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
tippin' down, i'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
bookin' my phone, findin' a chick i wanna bone

best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
commentators ringside try watchin my paper

most of the best is in the essence

you'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk

Smile|Scarface|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
there's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
that's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
but through whatever you see
through all the rain and the pain
you gotta keep your sense of humor
you gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
remember that!
mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! yeah


our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
no fairy tales for this young black male
some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
hustlers hardly think of culture
or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
wishin' i live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
why shed tears? save your sympathy
my childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
if you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
to all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!


smile for me, won't you smile? (smile for me now)
just smile, smile for me (smile)
(what you lookin' all sad for?
nigga, you black, smile for me now)
smile for me
(nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
won't you smile? (no doubt, smile for me now)
just smile (and the next generation)


now, as i open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
and you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases i wrote
and i can walk you through the days that i done
i often wish that i could save everyone, but i'm a dreamer
have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
look back on childhood memories, and i'm still feelin' the pain
turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
and a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
but when i focus on reality we broke and in chains
had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but i did
and after all my momma's thankin' god for blessin' the child
all my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!


smile for me, won't you smile?
just smile, smile for me
smile for me
won't you smile? just smile


fuck the world, as we elope and witness furious speeds
unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious g's
backstabbed and bleedin'
crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
inhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames
will i be smothered by my own pain?
strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
hit us off, give us plenty centuries
forgive my sins, since i entered many penitentiaries
the best revenge is ""fuck friends!"" – we military minded soldiers
bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find jehovah
to help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
scared to drop a seed hopin' i ain't cursed my babies
maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
embrace my words, make the world change
and still i smile, nigga


and now a moment of silence, let us pray
and as you journey into outerspace
may the angels help to lead the way
may the prayers that our families made
shine up on your soul to keep you safe
and all the homies that done passed away
they there to greet you as you pass the gates
and as you headed to the tunnel's light
i hope it leads to eternal life
we say the prayers for our homie 'pac


smile, smile for me
all you need to do is smile
woooo smile for me
come on, smile for me"

i'm bringing pain like two bad nurses
in the pain from these here motherfuckin' verses
ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
to the dirt shit first picks and usin' autos to work with
slugs to the shirt shit (just to squirt shit)
i’m hitting it with an expert kick
and burst 'til the earth split leave you hurt bitch
show you how worser than worst get in the zone
see the vein when the pain repel
and then they closin' the curtains bitch
(when adrenaline's pumpin')
i don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
i'm a misunderstood nigga, and i'm off my square
high got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit


what can i say to make you see how the fuck i feel
to make me wanna jump off of the edge?
i’m charged up like scarface gettin' shot up on the ledge
no pain, instead of 'caine i took a blunt off to the head
(so tell me what it said)
retaliate with lethal repercussion
i feel the reefer rushin'
to go into thangs like it's a wicked stick
took the benadryl, hot like i'm finna steal
to get the kickin' shit
for niggas and bitches that i kick it with
i was born to get you pumped up
it's like some lead bust
'cause i give motherfuckers a head rush
then yo' heads bust when you jumped up
'cause what i said must've got you geeked
my eyes red, puffed
from smokin' shit that niggas hit on to die
make me wanna slip the clip on the side
and if you act a bitch on the side
if we have to then the whole westside'll let the shit go on
and ride when the trigga bust

what i've accomplished
yung buk's my accomplice
located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
and started on a journey to establish to stop this
worshipped in the hearts of all the niggas to get 'em charged
what's the real reason?
all you haters tried to murder me, so now it's kill season
and even though i'm still bleedin'
i'ma keep comin' because i'm still breathin'
and y'all can't trace me
i'm burying my victims in the wall like gacy, too lyrical
and since the snip of my umbilical, these flows been critical
my music is miracle, it's like i'm biblical
kill like i'm nuttier than buddy love
and still wouldn't leave a bloody glove
and start the truck up
and speed the fuck up
getaway, smokin' the blunt up
adrenaline pumpin' veins, erupt, i'm pumped up


and i'm calibrated at 360 degrees
see that's 300 niggas that's gon' die
'bout 60 slugs to do this deed

we too much for the industrialist to fuck with this
on the brink of fuckin' up some shit
dismantle, deduct some shit
it's hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
(what niggas got nerves to do)
so i guess i'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you
then think what i'm on the verge to do
and i got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo' curtains fool

me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club


i got a ho named reel-to-reel
she got a buddy named sp-12, now you know the deal
we gets freaky in the studio late-night
that's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight
somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
if you's a player in the game this'll hold you
more money, more money for the bank roll
stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
a lot of fools put the salt in the game
to where these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
huh, i run my own, and i'm my own self-person
no respect make the situation worsen
fillmore, h.p., and sunnydale
there's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
lakeview, p.h., and army street
a different part of town, a different kind of freak
i just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
and press play on remote at the playaz club


me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club
(more champagne, mr. forté?)


from day one i had to get my money right
me, fly, and frankie j, we took an airplane flight
huh, they wanted to hear a rap, i said ""alright, bet""
we dropped a beat, i grabbed the mic, and then they wrote a check
a few g's for the pocket, no hesitation
took a flight back to the golden state, and
shops made orders from a whole new capital
the word was gettin' out, 4-tay's out-rappable
don't need a glock, but i bought one just in case
a sucka try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
know the chase is on, because it don't stop
i got the beat and got the rap, you make the glock pop
so treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
by the way, just in case you never heard of rappin' 4-tay
i'm on the smooth tip
never trippin' on them suckas poppin' off at the lip
i pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
leave the gat at the house, bring some dominoes
kick off your shoes, relax, and get a body rub
and shoot your mackin' at these women at the playaz club


me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club


you can't resist it, but don't get it twisted
vip, that means the number's not listed
membership is based on clout
and how you carry yourself; now homie, what you all about?
i stack paper and kick it with the o.g.'s
some got a nine-to-five, some took a lot of kis
you can learn a whole lot from a playa
a lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme-sayer
a lot of people get a misconception
and start drifting in the wrong direction
miss goody two-shoe, i'll see you later
i ain't got time, you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
i'd rather kick it with the crew in arizona
they chop game like we do in california
another show, another flow, a new bank account
but cash money comes in large amounts
so get your membership, but never slip to lameness fast
or else fly will have to tap that ass
and drop you to the ground, and make your knees scrub
it's just an everyday thang at the playaz club


me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it in the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the playaz club
me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
we chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the playaz club
check the pool, or kick it in the tub

Lifesaver|Guru|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
mmm, is this really the end, or is it a new beginning?
a new reality..

chorus: guru + baybe (repeat 2x)

so many misconceptions (don't be misled)
so many evil deceptions (oh i am)
i've come to give direction
for i, am the lifesaver (the life)


scooby doo wah, scooby doo wee
like a jazz player, i improvise wisely
free with the style, i flow like the nile
but remember, don't mistake the smile
deep rooted is my rhymin
like ancient african griots, precise is my timing
but let me get to the essence of what i'm sayin here
too many blood red streets with bodies layin there
the systematic fanatics are at it again
tryin to kill me and all of us my friend
but don't bend to the mental strain
against all odds, we must strive for essential gains
be true to the life the lord gave ya
and that's a message from the lifesaver
the lifesaver..

chorus


oh i am, the life (i.. am the lifesaver)
i am, the life.. yeah


it takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight
than to set one off, knowledge i'll let some off
cause nowadays, everybody's a killer
and as for me, no other mc is iller
but still a thorn scrapes my heart
when i see another life that's been torn apart
over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence
that the money only takes precedence
cause everybody wants power
while the innocent are born or die, during every hour
i scowl as i look upon evil
but i must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people
and we will learn to respect our neighbors
another message from the lifesaver
the lifesaver..

chorus


people talk about the armaggedeon
and nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son
each day's another test
aiyyo i better do my best, cause a lot's ridin on my chest
so when i lead you to the water, you best know
how to swim across, so you can reach the border
it's international, the message and the flavor
so here's some more important words from the lifesaver
the lifesaver.. (i am the life)
the lifesaver..


garçon, fâché, grandissant dans la violence et la pisse
le mot peace, c'est pour ceux qui périssent
chaque jour, aux alentours, dans le monde et ses tours
en prison ou retour en arrière dans les fours
et les condés font leur rondes, les villes grondent
la terre chauffe les sommets de montagne fondent
blondin ça passe black ça casse
tel est mon uniforme dans une guerre entre races
on me regarde, me met en garde, à vue
certains cafardent, d'autres bavardent, et tuent
dédicace à tout quartier, toute cité, aux pas de chance
à ceux qui sont tombés mais pas pour la france
pays trop bidon, vivement armageddon
j'ai raison, priant jéhovah pour mon pardon
car si un flic me juge je le droite
enfonçant mon doigt dans son oeil et le fond de son cerveau je gratte
... (goes off to fade)

so many evil deceptions

It's Funky Enough|The D.O.C.|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
y'all ready for this
rastafara sonna madda fa
drop the lyrics, a'ight


one, and here comes the two to the three and four
then i drop the beat i have in store
lay dynamics on the top like a rug
make it sound smooth and later make a dub
enunciate well, so that you can tell
i am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
nothin' like an idiot, get it
you want the record, cool, i'm with it
let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
as i turn the knob of the door you escape through
go in like a knot, don't be a puff
and i let it play cause dre's getting funky enough


it's funky, it's funky 
dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
it's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky 
watch the smooth lyrics that take place


if you want another reason why it must be funky
yo, i am not a jackass meanin' not a donkey
so i will play the game like it should be played
drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction
brothas say i'm dope, and the others say i'm bitchin'
no crowd can avoid the d-o to the c
when i'm p-e-r-f-o-r-m-i-n-g
on the stage, see the simple fact is i am dope
and known, i rock a funky beat without a cord so
it is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
and i will ascend with the style that i am using
knowin' that it's tough and it's not a bluff
i think i'll let it play cause dre's hittin' funky enough


dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it


listen to the kick, drop in with the click
and with no rehearses i'm dropping funky verses
stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
you love it when it rattles is the fact that i'm buying on
suckers never come close cause of knowing
there is no stopping the d.o.c. when i'm flowin'
but in the event that someone will try and juice this
stop him in his tracks, show him that i am ruthless
i don't give a damn, don't think that i am jokin'
cause i don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
yo people tell me this, yo dre you must stop him
but with no frills, so i just drop him
continue with the rhyme and make sure i get mine
with no static cause i sold an smg to get my nine, but
lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
let it play when the people say, dre yo you're getting funky enough


deal with the d-o to the c


i need a break so i can check around
see who the hell who is sittin' down
i want all chairs off the floor
and if he stands to the wall, show him the door
and i'll kick in the beat to give you something to rock to
to go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
percieve, but can't believe you're being taken
by a beat so cool you start shaking
and shivering, cause i'm delivering the answer
heaven sent if you’re a hellified dancer
you tried sittin' but it just won't work
cause the beat is so fresh
don't even tell it won't be funky enough


and with the help of the dr. dre, kick it


it's getting funky on the mix now, right
it's getting funky on the mix now, right
it's getting funky on the mix now, right
it's getting funky on the mix now
put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy"

do you think about me now and then?
'cause i'm comin' home again (ow!)
-min' home again


i met this girl when i was three years old
and what i loved most, she had so much soul
she said, ""excuse me, lil homie, i know you don't know me
but my name is windy and i like to blow trees.""
and from that point, i never blow her off
niggas come from out of town, i like to show her off
they like to act tough, she like to tore 'em off
and make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
and when i grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
i told her in my heart is where she'll always be
she never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
she said, ""it felt like they walked and drove on me.""
knew i was gang affiliated, got on tv and told on me
i guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
she said, ""'ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""


i'm comin' home again
do you think about me now and then?
do you think about me now and then?
'cause i'm comin' home again

do you think about me now and then?
do you think about me now and then? oh!
now i'm comin' home again
maybe we can start again


but if you really cared for her
then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
sometimes i still talk to her
but when i talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
she said, ""you left your kids, and they just like you
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you,"" and i just got through
talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
i guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
i guess that's why i'm here and i can't come back home
and guess when i heard that? when i was back home
every interview, i'm representin' you, makin' you proud
reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around

pretend to listen for an hour, then we leaving to the pad
roll that ass over, then i eat it from the back
vip up in your party, with the baddest here

i don’t have light bulb moments, i have chandeliers
getting high to fuck, bitches are kinky
g’s on repeat, like when i listen to fifty
“thats my girl!”, said i’m bringing her with me
she’ll be back in morning, breath stinking of whiskey
when these sluts around me, they know how to act
occasionally i rap, so getting x’s in our chats
your bea up on my lap, when she naked in my pad
she making that shit clap, when she take it from the back
never judge a girl, by her profile pic
just fishing for those likes, when they shows those tits
filters all over, that photo clicked

before i get a girl, living all my fantasies
first double check she looks the same up in reality
thats the difference bruh, between you and i
you never come correct, i always do it right
kissing on your girl, fuck the bro code bitch
saying that i won’t, while she blows my dick

‘ish know my stance, won’t hold your hand
we won’t slow dance, theres no romance
go back to ex man, go head fam

Back In The Day|Ahmad Lewis|hip-hop-rap-trap|"title sequence

cut to: stairs leading to subway

a number of people leave the subway.

jessica: (narrating) all it takes is one word, one suggestion, and they're no longer in control. all they know is a singular, intense need to follow me.

jessica examines a photograph, taken of her from the top of the stairs.

jessica: (narrating) to photograph me. to not get caught.

cut to a busy intersection. jessica holds another photograph. she looks around, figuring out where it was taken from.

jessica: (narrating) kilgrave's spy has no distractions, just an acute focus on me. fortunately, not luke. no photos of him. he should be safe.

jessica's cellphone vibrates. she looks at her phone.

jessica: shit.

cut to: jessica's apartment

jessica exits the elevator. malcolm is trying to get into his apartment. a woman is outside jessica's. the woman turns around.

audrey: jessica jones?

jessica: yeah?

audrey: audrey eastman. i know i'm early. i just want to get this over with.

jessica: you mentioned your divorce lawyer referred you. i'd love to thank him. what was his name?

audrey: desmond tobey. he's at hogarth, chao, & benowitz. i hope you're as good as he says you are.

jessica: i am.

audrey: so is that sign just for show, or do you actually have an office?

jessica takes out her keys. behind her, malcolm drops his.

audrey: that man has been trying to get into his apartment for, like, five minutes. nice building.

audrey walks into jessica's apartment. jessica walks over to malcolm.

jessica: hey. you good?

malcolm: you care?

jessica unlocks his apartment for him.

jessica: just don't wanna be another reason for you to get high.

malcolm: don't need a reason.

cut back to jessica's apartment. jessica sits at her desk, audrey stands across from her.

audrey: carlo thinks i'm an idiot. but i can smell it on him every time he sneaks into bed at 3:00 in the morning. wouldn't be his first affair, either. some people can't keep their lives in check. they just go along blindly ruining the lives of everyone in their path. i'm sick of pretending it doesn't matter. how long have you been in business?

jessica: why do you ask?

audrey: i want to know that if i write you a check, you'll stick around long enough to earn it.

jessica: i'll earn it.

audrey: sorry... it's carlo. i thought i'd gotten used to his lies and his wandering penis. my lawyer says that i need pictures for the divorce, of carlo and his...

jessica: mistress.

audrey: skank! nothing plays like pictures in court. he'll ask for alimony. i'm not giving him shit! i need you to catch him in flagrante. you know, in the act -

jessica: i know what in flagrante means.

audrey: carlo says he's meeting a client friday night. of course, when i asked his assistant, she knew nothing about it. follow him after work, i guarantee he will go straight form the office to her.

jessica: the kind of pictures you're asking for, they're hard to look at. they're harder to forget.

audrey: that's what i pay my shrink for.

jessica: circle of life.

audrey: look, i... i don't care if you have to knock down his door to do it. i want you to get those pictures! in fact, i want him to know that he is being photographed.

jessica: so that's it? follow your husband and take sex pictures?

audrey: isn't that enough?

jessica: and your divorce lawyer. dexter...

audrey: desmond tobey.

jessica: tobey, right. he referred you to me himself?

audrey: yes, i already told you that!

jessica: and you haven't had any conversations with a british man? dark hair, well dressed?

audrey: what?

jessica: standard contract. i require a 50% deposit up front.

audrey stands for a moment, then goes over to her purse. jessica's phone vibrates.

jessica: hey.

trish: he's back.

jessica: trish, what's going on?

trish: he knows i'm alive.

outside of trish's apartment is simpson and another officer.

trish: kilgrave sent that, that cop back to kill me. there's two of them, and they're right outside.

jessica: go to your safe room. i'm on my way.

trish: okay.

trish runs to her safe room. cut to outside her apartment. simpson is trying to try to knock down the door, while some of trish's neighbors look on. the other officer comes out of the elevator.

officer: hey, sarge, the doorman doesn't have the key. he said it's some kind of reinforced security door.

simpson: get the ram.

cut to trish's balcony. jessica climbs over the side. trish runs out of her safe room to let jessica in.

trish: they're still here.

jessica and trish walk over to her front door. outside, simpson is trying to break the door down with a battering ram.

officer: everybody clear the hall, please. you sure there's a body in there?

simpson: i'm sure.

jessica: kilgrave didn't send him back.

trish: then why is he trying to break down my door?

jessica: he thinks he killed you. i recognize that look.

simpson continues to hit the door. jessica opens it.

simpson: it's you.

officer: um, sarge, that's not trish walker.

simpson: no, no, this is the one who -

jessica: sorry, we had our headphones in. i'm helping trish make a party mix. everything okay?

simpson: you're with ms. walker?

trish: yes, she's with me. this is my apartment.

officer: are you all right ma'am?

trish: i'm fine.

officer: any violent incidents we should know about? anybody try to hurt you?

trish: i think i would know if i'd been attacked.

officer: we're real sorry for the disturbance, ms. walker. uh, by the way, really big fan of your show back in the day. (singing) it's patsy! i really wanna be your friend -

trish: that's sweet, thanks for watching.

officer: we gotta go sarge.

simpson: oh, uh, wait, i... i don't understand. no, no, no.

officer: hey, sergeant, take it easy.

simpson: you gotta tell me what's going on. tell me what's happening.

officer: hey, come on man, leave the lady alone.

jessica: it's fine, he can stay.

the other officer leaves. trish looks worried.

simpson: i mean, how can you be standing here? how can you be alright?

trish removes her scarf to reveal bruises on her neck.

trish: i am not alright!

jessica: trish, come on.

simpson: i'm... i'm a goddamn monster.

simpson begins to leave. jessica closes the door and follows him. trish listens to their conversation from inside her apartment.

jessica: she knows it wasn't you. she's just being dramatic.

trish: dramatic?

jessica: come on. you could use some air.

jessica leads him to the elevator.

cut to: outside

jessica and simpson walk around a park.

jessica: she's alive. you've seen it. the best thing you can do for her is stay away.

simpson: no, i felt her dying in my hands. she was dead.

jessica pulls out the sufentanil.

jessica: sufentanil. it knocks people out. this is what made you think that you killed trish.

simpson: you know, i've spent my whole life protecting people.

jessica: you're still you. you just need time to -

simpson: i did things in the line of duty, horrible things, but i have never wanted to kill an innocent woman.

jessica: do you want to kill her now?

simpson: no, god, no!

jessica: no, because you never did. kilgrave wanted it.

simpson kilgrave?

jessica: and he made you do it.

simpson: well, how?

jessica: it doesn't matter how. he told you to jump, you jumped. he's done with you.

simpson: well, he also told me to kill ms. walker. is he done with her, too?

jessica: look, just go home, go to sleep, and move on.

simpson: what happens when he finds out that she's still alive?

jessica: i'll handle it.

simpson: he'll send somebody else, won't he? it won't end till we stop him!

jessica: it will end when i stop it. you have no idea what's involved here.

simpson: well, i know there's a guy who controls minds, and there's a woman who flew out of the sky to save my life.

jessica begins to leave. simpson grabs her.

simpson: i may not have your abilities, but i've got eight years special ops and an entire police force to back me up.

jessica grabs his arm.

jessica: no police. i will handle it. you're not gonna make her feel safe, sergeant. go home. i got her covered. i think i know a way to get her off kilgrave's hit list. but it's gonna be painful.

jessica walks away.

cut to: trish's studio

trish is about to go live. jessica sits in the next room with trish's assistant.

assistant: and we're live in three, two...

trish: hi, i'm trish walker, and this is trish talk. during my last broadcast, i made some... flippant and disrespectful comments about a certain individual. i was out of line by belittling this man, and ignorant of my own limitations in challenging him. he is a very fascinating and powerful man, deserving of respect, and to that end, if he's listening, and i think he is... i want to apologize. i hope he forgives me.

jessica nods. cut to them walking on the sidewalk outside.

trish: i need a shower.

jessica: saying the words doesn't make it true. remember acting? it's how you won that award.

trish: my mom blew half the jury to get me that award. it might not have been about my acting.

jessica: fine, but kilgrave knows you're afraid of him, and that's all he cares about.

trish: men and power, it's seriously a disease. (jessica stops walking.). i mean, superpowered man, but...

trish notices that jessica has stopped walking and stops too.

trish: jess?

jessica is looking at a man with a camera pointed at her, who is taking photos. jessica quickly walks towards him, only to realize he's taking pictures of someone else.

trish: jess? jess, are you okay?

jessica: yeah, i just thought i... saw someone i knew.

trish: yeah, no teen choice award for you. talk.

jessica: kilgrave's been surveilling me. taking pictures.

trish: why?

jessica: i don't know. so he can record me imploding as he tortures me? the spy could be anyone, or everyone. it's been going on for weeks. i had no idea.

trish: just breathe, okay? he isn't here now.

jessica: yeah, well, he's always here.

jessica points her her head, then turns and begins walking again. trish follows her.

cut to: jessica's apartment

jessica sits at her computer, deleting pictures of luke.

jessica: (narrating) i don't need reminders of what i did to luke. even if i had good intentions. mostly.

cut to: hogarth's office

hogarth sits at her desk, talking to someone on speaker phone.

hogarth: listen to me, larry. you are never gonna win this one.

larry: oh, are you a legislator now? are you gonna rewrite the patent law?

hogarth: i'm not going to have to. do you have any idea how much people love their pets? your clients poisoned their pets, abusing manufacturing loopholes in china. you know who people hate more than litigators?

jessica bursts into the room, followed by pam.

hogarth: puppy killers.

larry: we can come in at half.

pam: she won't wait. she wouldn't listen.

jessica: i couldn't hear you over that print.

hogarth: larry, let me call you back.

hogarth hangs up. pam leaves.

hogarth: that was a potential fifty-million-dollar settlement. now i have to ramp him back up.

jessica: oops. i need to know if your firm represents audrey eastman. she says she's with desmond tobey.

hogarth: well, then you should be invading tobey's office.

jessica: i did. are 'attorney-client privilege' the only words that he knows? he wouldn't even tell me if he referred her to me.

hogarth: what's going on? you're on edge.

jessica: the last people referred to me wound up dead in my elevator. if audrey eastman follows the same path, she won't be able to pay her legal bills.

hogarth: she is a client, i'll confirm that.

jessica: and do you trust him? tobey?

hogarth: he's a partner.

jessica: that's not an answer.

hogarth: he's handling my own divorce, so yes, i trust him.

jessica: okay, good, that's all i need to know.

hogarth: you need to pull yourself together. you are coming across distinctly paranoid.

jessica: everyone keeps saying that. it's like a conspiracy.

jessica leaves.

cut to: alleyway

jessica is crouched high up in an alleyway, stalking audrey. her phone vibrates. she answers it.

jessica: i'm working.

trish: what if the apology didn't work?

jessica: then i'll deal with it. look, i'm with a client right now. sort of.

trish: how can you trust any client after what happened with hope's parents.

jessica: i don't. which is why i've been following her since dawn.

trish: following who?

jessica: a jealous wife.

trish: jess, come on, i need the distraction.

jessica: fine. a jewelry designer. audrey eastman.

trish: overpriced, chunky, enamel stuff? well, if she is mind-controlled, that would explain some of her jewelry.

jessica: it's not like she needs the money. her parents died and left her a fortune, but all she does is work.

trish: cheating husband. she's compartmentalizing.

jessica: useful skill.

trish: how will you know if she's kilgraved?

jessica: his effect has limits.

trish: right. time and distance. but you can't follow her forever.

jessica: i've never seen his voodoo last longer than 10 hours, 12 tops. if he doesn't show soon, i'll... do the job and take pictures of the cheater with his pants around his ankles. nothing plays like pictures.

cut to: police car

simpson sits in his police cruiser. his phone rings, and he answers it.

simpson: yeah?

jessica: you still wanna help catch kilgrave?

simpson: yes.

jessica: it's a little illegal.

simpson: answer's still yes.

jessica: can you get me a police surveillance video?

simpson: who are you looking for?

jessica: myself. kilgrave's got somebody tailing me, feeding him pictures. police footage will show who's around me.

simpson: yeah, well, we have cameras all over the city. you got times, dates, locations?

jessica: texting them to you now.

simpson: i got your six.

they both hang up. jessica scoffs.

jessica: 'got my six'.

jessica sees audrey leaving and follows her.

cut to: sidewalk outside a restaurant

hogarth and pam are walking to a restaurant.

pam: it's an hour north of rome. my sister said the views from the hotel are amazing.

hogarth: unbelievable. two more walk-ins because of that goddamn radio interview.

pam: can i have my jeri back, please? i would love to have lunch without us bringing the office with us.

hogarth: i'm sorry. i'm here. and i promise you, after this circus is over, i will take you anywhere you want to go. okay?

pam: okay.

inside, wendy kisses a man and leaves. they meet outside.

wendy: oh, come on. don't tell me you're bringing her here.

pam: we have a reservation.

hogarth: wendy, you don't have exclusive rights to every restaurant we've ever been to.

wendy: just the one where you proposed.

pam: you proposed to her here? jesus, jeri.

wendy: did you forget?

hogarth: i didn't forget proposing, no.

wendy: (to pam) well, that's worse for you than for me, because it means she's fine giving you leftover romance.

pam: let's just go somewhere else.

hogarth: no!

wendy: if she orders you the tiramisu and there is a diamond ring at the bottom, you'll think nothing could ever make you stop feeling happy. don't choke on it.

hogarth: you think, if you break us up, that i will crawl back to you? read my face. never gonna happen.

wendy walks away, tearing up.

hogarth: she does not get this goddamn restaurant.

pam: yeah, she does.

pam walks away.

cut to: sidewalk in another part of the city

jessica watches audrey from behind a car.

jessica: (narrating) if audrey eastman is controlled by kilgrave, it's going to wear off soon. he'll need to re-up.

audrey unlocks a shady, abandoned building, and goes inside. it looks to be an abandoned bar. she lays her things on the bar and turns on a speaker system. loud rock music starts playing. she takes a gun out of her purse. jessica jumps up onto a dumpster to get a better view inside of the building. she sees audrey, with mufflers on, shooting.

jessica: shit.

jessica breaks the lock on the back door and sneaks in. jessica gets the sufentanil ready. audrey has a number of female dummies set up to practice shooting.

jessica: (narrating) thirteen hours and no kilgrave, but... she's planning to use that on someone. maybe the wandering penis?

jessica leaves as audrey continues shooting.

cut to: hogarth's firm

a number of people are in line at the lobby.

pam: name, address, daytime phone, medical history, including any visits to a psychiatric facility. next.

pam sees jessica and gestures for her to go meet hogarth.

jessica: your text said it was urgent.

hogarth: it is.

jessica: yet there's no gun to your head. i don't like being summoned.

hogarth: quelle surprise. i have a job for you.

jessica: who are all these people?

hogarth: they claim they were mind-controlled by kilgrave. you should have seen the ones we turned away.

jessica: maybe some of them are legit.

hogarth: oh, please. the trish talk interview turned him into the most popular alibi in the city.

jessica: you bought dr. kurata's kidney story, why not at least talk to them.

hogarth: because i don't have time for this right now. because i have bigger problems, okay? wendy has decided to make this divorce very difficult for me, and i need dirt on her.

jessica: that's why you called me? i have a gun-toting client, a spy to find -

hogarth: you owe me a favor.

jessica: you were married to her. you already have dirt.

hogarth: she didn't know mine.

jessica: well, you're sneaky. that doesn't mean she is.

hogarth: i didn't say it would be easy. god.

jessica: fine. later. who's first?

a number of heads in the room turn to look at jessica. cue a montage of jessica and hogarth filming interviews with potential victims of kilgrave.

jessica: start at the beginning.

man 1: i wen into 7-eleven for a bag of doritos, you know? and then this chinese dude comes in, and his eyes were all red and glowing, and i was like, 'dude!'

hogarth rolls her eyes.

mother: my lucy is a nice girl. a virgin. tell them. go ahead.

a visibly pregnant teenager sits down.

lucy: kilgrave made me do it. he's our gardener.

jessica listens incredulously.

man 2: he landed on jones beach. i thought it was a meteor. but then, a man came out of the waves.

cut to a woman with bandages on her hands.

woman 1: he lived with me for two days. he made me play my cello for him, until i made a mistake.

man 1: he didn't even talk, man! he just like, stared at me with his freaky glowing eyes. i was like, 'this dude is making me wanna jack this place.' i pulled out my gun...

woman 2: i couldn't stop smiling. he wouldn't let me.

lucy: he said, 'you want me bad'. and then i did want him. bad.

mother: and not just lucy. all the girls in the neighborhood. when he speaks, they spread their legs. evil man.

man 2: he gave me a purple staff, and made me slide it up my...

jessica's eyes widen.

man 3: he had dreads.

man 4: bald.

woman 1: dark hair.

woman 2: he wore a white dress shirt.

woman 1: intense eyes.

woman 2: and a tie.

man 1: a red t-shirt. i think.

lucy: he never wears a shirt. he's hot.

man 5: i was waiting for the l train. and he said, uh, 'nice jacket. you wanna give it to me, right?' and i said, 'yeah'. and, like an asshole, i handed it over. now, i know it's not the same as killing my parents, but... it was zegna. that limey cocksucker owes me five grand.

jessica: limey?

man 5: yeah, he had an accent. he's british.

jessica: get up.

man 5: i'm telling the truth!

jessica: get up.

jessica gets up and looks the man over. she imagines him as kilgrave.

jessica: put him on the list.

cut to a conference room. jessica addresses a group of people.

jessica: talk amongst yourselves. exchange info. thanks.

jessica leaves the room.

hogarth: what was that about?

jessica: we're starting a band. i told them to keep in touch. talk.

hogarth: you starting a support group? will you be participating?

jessica: like i'd waste my time circle jerking with a bunch of whiners.

jessica begins walking away.

hogarth: yes, you are a paragon of mental health.

jessica comes back.

jessica: i'm using them, hogarth. i wanna know everything they did with him, everywhere they went, every word that was said, particularly about me, and what the hell he's gonna do next.

hogarth: kilgrave wanted a leather jacket, live cello music, and the flattering smile of a pretty girl. what a waste. he could solve so many problems with his gift.

jessica: gift?

hogarth: i just meant if... if he was on our side.

jessica: what side would that be? the side that uses people? treats them like animals?

hogarth: jessica, do not take this out on me.

jessica: just to throw them away like they're garbage? the side that rips your life apart and destroys you from the inside out? whose side exactly would that be?

jessica punches a nearby door, cracking the glass. she leaves.

cut to: street at night

jessica walks outside. after a few moments, simpson approaches her.

simpson: hey! hey, i got your movie. it's thirty hours. cast of thousands.

he hands her a tape. she walks into a nearby building.

jessica: thanks. i should've got some popcorn.

he follows her into the building.

simpson: listen, there's a lot to comb through, but your spy is in there somewhere.

simpson sees malcolm hiding in a corner of the lobby.

simpson: hey! what are you looking at, huh? what the hell are you looking at, huh?

he lifts malcolm up against the wall.

jessica: hey, get off him!

simpson: he's watching!

jessica: yeah, he's probably watching the ceiling melt.

malcolm: he doesn't like me.

jessica: malcolm, go sleep it off.

malcolm walks away.

jessica: hey, i got enough to deal with without worrying about you going all search and destroy on me.

simpson: i know, i am... i know how to turn it off, i... the paranoia and the panic, i just -

jessica: listen, there's this... group of people. they've all been through the same thing, so... if you wanna talk or something, they meet tomorrow night.

simpson gives her a weird look.

jessica: yeah, i'm not into it either.

simpson: i gotta go.

simpson quickly leaves. cut to jessica watching the tape he gave her. she tries matching up a picture with the video, but the position of the photographer is just out of view.

jessica: goddamn it.

she pulls up a picture of luke.

jessica: (narrating) now i know how it feels, someone watching your every move. seeing you in private moments.

she stands up, counts some money, grabs the sufentanil, and leaves. cut to her walking on the sidewalk. a little girl walks up onto the sidewalk.

girl: jessica. are you jessica?

jessica: yeah. where are your parents?

girl: patsy walker is safe.

jessica: what did you say?

girl: you don't have to worry about her, for now.

jessica: who told you that?

girl: the man. he said he liked her apology.

jessica: how old are you?

girl: eight and a half.

jessica: i'm sorry that this is happening to you.

girl: you're a bitch! you could have stopped that bus! you left him there to die in the street, like a goddamn dog.

jessica: stop it.

girl: you turn everything to shit.

jessica: jesus.

girl: it's friday.

jessica: what does that mean?

girl: don't you have a job to do?

jessica: are you talking about audrey? did kilgrave send audrey? did he send audrey? was he at her target practice?

jessica grabs the little girl by the arm. the girl screams.

girl: mommy! where's mommy?

jessica: it's okay, i'm going to help you find your mom!

woman: chanise!

girl: mommy! she won't let me go!

jessica: sorry! i'm sorry.

woman: are you okay? did she hurt you baby?

jessica: she was lost, i was just trying to help.

woman: stay away from her!

cut to: trish's apartment

the doorbell rings. trish sees simpson outside.

trish: what are you doing here?

simpson: i'm sorry to show up like this. i just wanted to make this right.

trish: you can't.

simpson: i got something for you.

trish: i don't want anything from you.

simpson: well, it might help. please. um... it's personal.

trish: i can't let you in. put it on the floor.

he puts the box on the floor outside the door.

trish: now go to the end of the hall.

simpson walks to the end of the hall. trish opens the door and quickly grabs the box, closing the door again. she opens it, revealing a gun.

simpson: did you open it?

trish: yes.

simpson: i just want you to feel safe.

trish: is it legal?

simpson: no. you still there?

on the other side of the door, trish holds the gun to where simpson's head is.

cut to: sidewalk

jessica follows carlo as he carries some flowers on the sidewalk.

jessica: (narrating) audrey was right about her husband. carlo's clearly not in a hurry to get home. cases like this remind me of why i'm single.

eventually, carlo reaches a building and enters.

jessica: (narrating). i could storm the gates and get the money shot... but not if kilgrave got to audrey somehow.

jessica jumps onto a balcony. inside, she sees carlo enter a room.

jessica: shit.

she opens a window and sneaks in. she sees carlo and a woman having sex. jessica's phone begins to vibrate. she answers it.

jessica: hello?

audrey: hi, it's audrey eastman.

jessica: yeah, i know.

audrey: did you follow him?

jessica: wait, what?

audrey: where are you? jessica? hello? jessica? are you there?

jessica moves her phone away from her ear and realizes audrey is in the room with carlo.

audrey: jessica? can you hear me? where - where is carlo?

jessica throws the doors open.

jessica: he's three feet to your right, asshole.

audrey stands up and trains her gun on jessica. carlo also stands up.

audrey: get her on the plastic.

carlo: how?

audrey: i have a gun on her for christ's sake carlo.

jessica: you shoot at me, i'll pull the bullet out of my ruined jacket and shove it up your ass with my pinky finger, and who do you think that's gonna hurt more?

carlo: you're bulletproof?

audrey shoots her in the arm. jessica yelps.

carlo: jesus!

audrey: nope, not bulletproof.

carlo: audrey, this is insane. honey, we don't have to do this. we can walk out of here right now.

audrey: she doesn't have laser eyes either, or she would have used them.

jessica: laser eyes? who said i had laser eyes? oh, that dick with the aston martin. i served him a subpoena.

audrey: gregory spheeris. i sell to his wife. they're very talky.

jessica: look, you're obviously pissed off about something, but i'm pretty sure, for the first time, this has nothing to do with kilgrave. he's smarter than you two.

audrey: kilgrave? who's kilgrave? is he another one of you people? how many more are there like you?

jessica: how many more what, private eyes?

audrey: gifted. stupid word. it's like calling someone special. they're not special, they're retarded. you're not gifted, you're a freak.

jessica: what have we or the mentally challenged ever done to you?

audrey: you saved the city. that's what the newspapers said. you were 'heroes'.

jessica: not me.

audrey: the city was saved. but i was there. i saw what really happened. i saw my mother crushed to death under a building that you people destroyed.

jessica: in the incident?

audrey: i was trying to pull my mother out from the rubble, watching her bleed to death, while all around me you people were raining down hell.

jessica: so go after the big green guy, or the flag waver! i wasn't even there!

audrey: consider it a preventative measure for next time!

jessica pulls a tarp out from under her, causing the gun to go flying.

jessica: you think you're the only ones who've lost people?

carlo goes for the gun, but jessica grabs it and throws it into a wall. she begins tearing the room apart.

jessica: you think you're the only ones with pain? you think you can take your shit and dump it on me? you don't get to do that! so you take your goddamn pain and you live with it, assholes! you lost your parents? welcome to the goddamn club! i lost mine in some random accident. do you see me trying to kill every shitty driver? no! because i don't work my shit out on other people! so keep your goddamn feelings to yourselves! ninety-nine. you wanted to know how many of us there are? the last time i counted, i had 99 gifted friends in this borough alone. and now every single one of them is gonna know about this shit that you tried to pull. and they hate attempted murder. they really do. the cops hate it too, you know, because it's against the law.

carlo: please don't kill us. we're gonna leave you alone.

jessica: there's only one thing that you can do to save yourselves.

audrey: what?

jessica: disappear. nobody, especially me, ever hears from you again. me and my friends will stop by tomorrow to make sure you heard me.

jessica leaves.

carlo: i want a divorce.

cut to: jessica's apartment

jessica is taking a shower. she looks at where the bullet hit her, and watches blood go down the drain. cut to her at her desk, looking at the files of people she interviewed. she watches a clip from one of the interviews, then closes her computer and leaves.

cut to: trish's apartment

trish and simpson sit on opposite sides of the door.

trish: and this one guy stitched a silhouette of my hair in orange sequins. and this girl sent me a stuffed, uh... it kind of looked like a voodoo doll.

simpson: of you?

trish: me or carrot top. it wasn't clear.

simpson: it's creepy.

trish: well, it seemed normal at the time. my mother had been marketing the patsy dolls for years, so, uh... the whole thing's a little embarrassing now.

simpson: i had g.i. joes, till they all burned.

trish: burned?

simpson: they went into battle to save my sister's barbie, and melted into one big clump.

trish: that's terrible.

simpson: hey, the accomplished their mission.

trish: by dying?

simpson: they rescued barbie. i mean, the dream house was gutted, but she had insurance.

trish: you used actual fire? you torched a dream house?

simpson: i was committed to the scenario.

they both laugh.

simpson: that was meant to be a story about how i've always been the guy saving people.

trish: albeit plastic people, and they melted.

simpson: well, i just need you to know that. the guy who tried to kill you, it wasn't me.

trish: i don't blame you.

simpson: well, you're doing better than me. i tried to fight it. i couldn't.

trish: hey, listen. what kilgrave did to you, he did to jessica. it doesn't matter how strong you are.

simpson: maybe not, but we can protect ourselves.

trish plays with the gun in her hands.

simpson: trish?

trish opens the door. simpson stands up.

trish: i might shoot you by accident.

simpson: it's worth the risk.

simpson enters her apartment.

cut to: sidewalk

jessica walks outside. she watches various people walk past her. she holds her arms out and spins around.

cut to: trish's apartment

trish and simpson sit and drink coffee.

simpson: you went back to work?

trish: i had to. i needed things to feel normal again.

simpson: yeah, so did i.

trish: ah, you're a new york city cop. i'm sure your normal is pretty crazy to begin with.

as the camera pans down, we see that trish is still holding the gun.

simpson: unlike being an actress.

trish: completely sane profession.

simpson: yeah.

cut to: sidewalk

jessica is walking on the sidewalk. her phone vibrates and she answers it.

jessica: hogarth.

hogarth: i sent more potential victims to your survivor's group.

jessica: it's not my survivor's group.

hogarth: maybe it should be. you need to process your trauma.

jessica: i'm sorry, who is this?

hogarth: fine. you need to not take your crap out on my glass walls.

jessica: put it on my tab.

hogarth: when are you planning to pay that off?

jessica: not tonight, hogarth. not tonight.

she hangs up on hogarth and enters a restaurant where the survivor's group is meeting. cut to jessica listening in on the group.

man: avery was crying because i forgot to put his action figures in the car. he'd been fussy all morning, and in the car, he was just impossible. i lost my temper. then we hit a red light just south of herald square, and kilgrave just opened the door and got in. said he liked my car, wanted to ride around. avery was still crying, but kilgrave never once looked at him. he just stared straight ahead and said, 'you'd like to leave your son, wouldn't you?' and i said yes. i pulled avery out, put him on the curb, and drove away. i saw him in my rear-view mirror, just weeping on the sidewalk, and i hated myself because... it's what i wanted. i disappeared for a week while i was kilgrave's chauffeur.

jessica looks up.

man: i was charged with child abandonment. my wife left me, which, i don't blame her, because -

jessica: you drove him for a week? 24/7?

man: yes, it was a nightmare. i was haunted by -

jessica: where did you drive him?

woman 1: i'm not sure that's the -

jessica: did he meet anyone in particular? did anyone deliver pictures to him?

man: um, actually, yeah.

jessica: who?

man: i don't know, i just had to drive kilgrave to meet the same guy every day at 10:00 a.m. on the dot. he was very punctual.

jessica: what did he look like?

woman 2: is this some kind of reenactment therapy?

jessica: screw therapy. what did he look like, the guy he met?

man: well, i never got close, and it was freezing. everyone's wrapped in tons of layers and hats. he wore a scarf. blue and white stripes.

jessica leaves the restaurant. cut to her back in her apartment. she looks through the security camera footage, trying to find someone like the man described. she eventually pauses the video, spotting the person. she realizes that it's malcolm. she breaks into his apartment, revealing a printer with some photos of her. in his apartment, she sees a picture of him with his mom. she starts tearing up.

Love The Way You Lie|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie


i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now, it's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe, but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right, it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her, the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
she fuckin' hates me, and i love it; ""wait! where you going?""
""i'm leaving you”, ""no, you ain't, come back!""
we're runnin' right back, here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad, it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snap, ""who's that dude?"", i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength


just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie


you ever love somebody so much
you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
you meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
you swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face
spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
throw 'em down, pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that's the culprit , it controls you both
so they say it's best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know ya
'cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane


just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie


now, i know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
but your temper's just as bad as mine is
you're the same as me when it comes to love
you're just as blinded, baby, please
come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk?
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time? there won't be no next time!
i apologize, even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games, i just want her back
i know i'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire, i'm just gonna

Professional Rapper (feat. Snoop Dogg)|Lil Dicky|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
hello, how can i help you?
hi, my name’s dave burd. i have an appointment today
it’s probably under 'lil dicky,' actually. i’m a… i’m a rapper, so…
okay, and who are you here to see?
uh, snoop dogg? says here 'snoop d-o-g-g'
oh, yeah. he’s right down the hall. first door to your right
give him a knock and he should be right with you
thanks. it’s uh, this door right here, right?
mm-hmm
thank you


grab a seat
thanks, i’m dave, very nice to meet
dave, what it do? you can call me dogg
let me just check your sheet
no problem, sir, let me just say
i’m a big fan of the shit that y’all make
i can’t lie, i been thinking about this all day
all good, there’s a reason that we called, dave, let me start with your background
where you come from?
sure, i was undergrad down there in richmond
before that
oh, you talking 'bout my hometown?
yeah
i was born out of philly grew up in a little silly old town called cheltenham
it was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
so real shit you ain’t never had to struggle for much
i wouldn’t say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
elaborate
well i ain’t never had a tool, but i had to be the man at school
like i was doing shit i had to do so when i finished undergrad, i’m cool and i can get whatever job i wanted
but the job you wanted wasn’t all that bumping
yeah, and i saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
when you been racing them rats, you ain’t been making them raps
boo-hoo what a hardship
how you paid to get the rap shit started?
man, my bar mitzvah money
but don’t diss me buddy, i wasn’t one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
i must’ve wanted this a lot, i had something to choose
ha, look at that, i can say there’s something to prove up in your ass
yeah, i guess
that’s enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?
oh my god, it’s the best
bitches let me draw up on their breasts
literally, i can reinvent myself
i get a forum to project myself
it’s never boring, every morning i wake up and try to best myself
i never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
it’s kinda healthy
cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
sure
in a club and a couple niggas threaten you
uh, i wouldn’t do shit
and i don’t even get what that got to do with this?
shut the fuck up, rap's like life
if you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little bitch
nah, that’s my niche!
don’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed
that’s the target i’ll hit
and that’s the heart of my pitch
i wanna do this whole thing different
what the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
uh, you know, i-i think, like, you know
traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
but traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?
nah, like, i get that, but i-i just think that, you know
you don’t know if it could be working even better
and i think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
i don’t mean any disrespect by that
i’m just saying i have a different background
like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant


so what are your biggest strengths?
well my flow is crazy, i can switch that amazing
for example, i can be like ain’t nobody fucking with lil dicky
when he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
ripping this shit like it’s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
cause i can switch it, deliver this shit in whatever cadence you bitches prefer
all right, all right, i get it
top of that, lyrically i’m pretty damn clever (go)
got a long bottom bitch, call the hoe neville (whoa)
and i blow it from the jump, derrick rose knee (oh)
you can say i’m pretty smart how i know better
and y’all been winning like pistorius, it’s no feat
bro, i can go on and on
i’m taking over and they mad like father-in-laws
ok enough of the punchline, that ain’t showing me you different than the other guys
well i don’t know if they can run it like that
but ain’t nobody else doing funny type rap
what’s that?
well i can tell a story about my morning
watching boy meets world and jerking off to topanga lawrence
like the 14 year old topanga
oh this shit like a joke to you?
i don’t get it
nah it ain’t like that i just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
like, as a guy
so when i get up on the mic i ain’t finna just lie
real recognize real, right?
yeah, i guess... so what you tryna do
five years from now, tell me 'bout the dude
well, i don’t care about the money
like, it’s the respect that i’m wanting
honestly, i just want to be one of the greats
where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
i don’t wanna leave the game the same
in a nutshell, what’s your legacy?
well, i wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand-up rap
put the random rap in demand like that for the people that was anti-rap
yet, the fans of rap start to recognize that anti-rap
is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
that shit sound pretty damn complex
i guess, i wanna be the best
i just wanna do it my way
and turn the whole game sideways
and show people you ain’t gotta be resigned to the highway
you can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
i ain’t mad at that
well thanks, man, that’s my plan of my attack
just let me in and i’ma rap the plaques
and i ain’t about to win them back to back
i’m 'bout to win them like it’s back to back to back to back to back
til i stop rapping
you ain’t even sold a damn album yet
true
that’s a lot of talk from a wily vet
let alone a young rook nigga
you misread me
nah this ain’t a book nigga
well that’s one of my flaws, i’m too competitive dawg
no, you just fucking repetitive dawg
i get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain’t shit until cheddar's involved
i get that i gotta prove myself
no shit you ain’t done shit
think about that though
only doing this a couple of years
one tape and i’m like this?
this shit is aight for your first shit
but you don’t know if it’s your worst shit
you don’t think finding out would be worth it?
it might be, it might not
but i’ma put your ass to work, kid
wait, like, like i have the job? like really?
well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together
what would you do for the hook for this song?
you want me to make a hook up right now?
do i look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
all right, uh, okay
man do the hook!
i’m 'bout to be professional
homie, i’m professional
uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?
nigga, that shit is garbage man
well, you know, i feel like there might have been some upside to it
but i’m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
don’t y’all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
sometimes, but you know, that was some next level dogg shit right there
yeah, you know, i’m just way better when i get to think things through
have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt?
right now?
yeah
sure


dope. juanita, bring some weed in here, please. thank you
(you got it, snoop. i’ll be right there.)
thanks, juanita. super nice woman
nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?
uh, i really don’t wanna be spoken to like that, so…
whatever. thanks
(hey, i got y’all y’all weed.)
damn, that’s some great looking weed. it’s just so early
(can i get you guys anything else while i’m here? coffee? tea? head? bottled water?)
d-did you just say head?
(yeah. you ain’t never got no head before?)
i mean… just feels like… a lot, right now
(ok.)
but what kind of tea do you guys have?
(we got mint, raspberry, earl grey, english breakfast...)

fuck up with me?
then you must not have heard
put me in dirt?
then i’ll fuck up the earth
do what i do when i fuck up a verse
but i’ll do it you when i fuck up the world
that’s how i react
hence why i feel like i need this track
won’t even take too long
all you gotta do is do me wrong


i’m feeling so offbeat
every step expecting to drop
knees down to the floor
and the ground couldn’t stop these thoughts
if i fell face flat/ can’t fail/ hate that
i’m back up on my feet that’s not me
run back to my comfort zone but i refuse to quit
‘cause i’m cool with this
take all my flaws/ make music with
i don’t know how these standard emcees
are reaching a point where they’re setting these standards
oh well/ hands off their coattails
eyes on your prize/ don’t gloat when your foes fail
‘cause it’s not about them
it’s all about you
don’t jump all smug at the front
and emerge as a prick
keep going/ ignore what they say
then do it like jay and just fuck up the world like…

that’s how i react
hence why i feel like i need this track
won’t even take too long
all you gotta do is do me wrong


feel like i’m overly critical
show it through poems and flow like i’m lyrical
fact is i map this anger out to a banger
and attack anyone who’s coming my way
like i’m doing right now
everything i write down
know it’s so typical
stone cold cynical
hope so miniscule
feel so lost but i feel so invincible
feel i can do it my way
thinking every minute
“kd, why wait?”
know i’ve got a talent but i’m still unsure
but that’s life in a cold world
just love yours; i tell myself
but still fail to accept any help
i feel like i’m doing it wrong
the newer the song
the better i feel
but never reveal
how i feel when i see they’re all moving along


fuck up with me?

hence why i feel like i need this track
won’t even take too long
all you gotta do is do me wrong


fuck this
frustrated, everything is too much
and i erupt in a rage/ can’t function
doused in a ‘bout of confusion and numbness
why do i care what the fuck you want?
i’m doing my thing so fuck you mugs
can’t dumb down when the gloves come off
i don’t care, either way, you’re getting punched up bruv
emcees throw a dismal punch
can’t spit/ no pistol when fists go up
so they talk slick/ tweet with their lips all shut
hidden when the villains let their pitbulls run
sniffing out their minimal ability
and kill ‘em within minutes of revealing where they stay
finish them/ it’s vicious/ unh
spit all i envision in my inner chamber
door’s locked/ no entry
i enter only when i vent i know me
i need that fuel and i ignore the danger
i go to god when i feel deranged
and i feel that anger and i can’t contain it
i slowly feel i might go insane
‘cause i’m running in circles inside my brain
it’s just madness/ climaxing
a hyperactive overload of life and passion so


fuck up with me?
then you must not have heard
put me in dirt?
then i’ll fuck up the earth
do what i do when i fuck up a verse
but i’ll do it you when i fuck up the world

some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
i'm all about i, give the rest of the vowels back
i like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
eat her till she cry—call that ""wine 'n' dine""
try to check me and i'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
they say ""choose wisely,"" that's why i was chosen
rockin' like the asphalt, it's the cash fault
looked in the face of death and took its mask off
now i like my house big and my grass soft
i like my girl's face south and her ass north
but i'm ray charles to the bullshit
now hop up on that dick and do a full split!


uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
and looked back and told me, ""baby, it's real.""
and i say, ""i ain't doubt you for a second.""
i squeeze it and i could tell how it feel
i wish we could take off
and go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘cause she bad so maybe she won't
uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
do it for the realest niggas
in the fuckin' game right now, she will
do it for the realest niggas
in the fuckin' game right now, she will
maybe for the money and the power
and the fame right now, she will
do it for the realest niggas
in the fuckin' game right now, she will"

Aquemini|OutKast|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie, and sometimes 'y'
nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
but until they close the curtain (y'all know), it's him and i: aquemini


now is the time to get on, like spike lee said, ""get on the bus""
go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must
is you on that dust or cornstarch? familiar with that smack, man?
the music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
pacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?
ridin' round old national on 18's without no gat, man
i'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
me and my nigga we roll together like batman and robin
we prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
but now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
in volkswagens and bonnevilles, chevrolets and coupe de villes
if you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel
for real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
instead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch


even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie, and sometimes ""y""
nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
but until they close the curtain, it's him and i: aquemini


twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
and beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball impalas
and street scholars, majoring in culinary arts
you know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough
from scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught
know what ya selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway
now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
it's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
it's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'
more than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
i'm sorry y'all, i often drift, i'm talking gift
so when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
of course you know i feel like the bearer of bad news
don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?
now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
is every nigga with golds for the fall? naw
so don't get caught up in appearance
it's outkast's aquemini, another black experience


even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie, and sometimes 'y'
nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
but until they close the curtain, it's him and i: aquemini


the name is big boi, daddy fat sax, the nigga that like them cadillacs
i stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
better know dat, some say we pro-black, but we professional
we missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
get off the testicles and the nutsacks
you bust rhyme, we bust back
get-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
you hear dat? you can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit
because aquemini is aquarius and  gemini runnin' shit like this


my mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
meet the twin—andré ben, welcome to the lion's den
original skin, many men comprehend
i extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
sin all depends on what you believing in
faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since mc ren
alien can blend right on in with your kin
look again, 'cause i swear i spot one every now and then
it's happening again, wish i could tell you when
andré, this is andré, y'all are just gon' have to make amends


even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie, and sometimes ""y""
nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
but until they close the curtain, it's him and i: aquemini

don't link me
don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
i know the truth is you won't love me until i'm gone
and even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
i can't even capture the feeling i had at first
meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
the people i look up to are goin' from bad to worse
their actions out of character even when they rehearse
workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
i gotta bring my brothers or else i feel out of place
breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
and they don't like that, it's written all on they face
i don't know how i'ma make it out of here clean
can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
iconic duos rip and split at the seams
good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
leavin' me in limbo to question what i believe
leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
leavin' me to not trust anybody i meet
leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?


you've got me fe–

you've got me fe–
you, ohhhh, ayy


missin' out on my years
there's times when i wish i was where i was
back when i used to wish i was here
missin' out on my days
scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
i'm tryna see who's there on the other end of the shade
most times it's just somebody that's underaged
that's probably just alone and afraid
and lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
i always hear people complain about the place that they live
that all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
that makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome
then she finally got to rome
and all she did was post pictures for people at home
'cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
i know another girl that's cryin' out for help
but her latest caption is ""leave me alone""
i know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
i know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
to post later and make it look like she still on the go
look at the way we live
i wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
i was hidin' the world from my kid
from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
breakin' news in my life, i don't run to the blogs
the only ones i wanna tell are the ones i can call
they always ask, ""why let the story run if it's false?""
you know a wise man once said nothin' at all
i'm exhausted and drained, i can't even pretend
all these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
all these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
i guess i'll make it to the end and i'ma find out then

it's the return of the wild style fashionist
smashin' hits, make it hard to adapt to this
put pizzazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this
dj's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
just pump the volume up, and play it loud
hip-hop's embedded, before i said i wouldn't let it
but me and the microphone is still magnetic
straight off the top, i knew i'd be forced to rock
dancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin' hot
hopin' i open rakim allah seminars
massage at the bar smokin' ten dollar cigars
while i admire midas, with more vision than tv's
i find it easy catchin' diabetes from fly sweeties
sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track
rockin' jams by popular demand, i'm back


i control the crowd, you know i hold it down
when it drop, you know it's jiggy
when you hear the sound
from town to town, until it's world-renowned
and i rock new york city all year around


it's on, so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
thought patterns displayed on persian rugs
equations are drawn up in paisley form
mic, it stay warm, my flow is evian
deep as a nautilus, you stay dipped in ra's style
from the shores of long island to panama canal
intellect pitches, new trends, like a clothes designer
i'm in effect, quicker than medicines in china
split the mic open, fill it with somethin' potent to go in
and take a toke then, mental planes start floatin'
hot science is smokin', altitudes cause chokin'
product is hypnotic, you're soakin' and still smokin'
showin' better scenes than grams of amphetamines
plans to scheme, means i'll forever fiend
long as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'
i'ma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'


i control the crowd, you know i hold it down
when it drop, you know it's jiggy
when you hear the sound
from town to town, until it's world-renowned
and i rock new york city all year around


yo, my rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
since fat crayons, i write and display chaos
my plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam is
i take advantage until the crowd go bananas
what a rush! i hear cuts, then i lust to touch
microphones get clutched by the illustrious
word spread i inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
born with three 7's in my head
in time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
to find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
with knowledge of scholarships, when ra be droppin' this
some of the things that i know will be in your next bible
when i die, go bury me and my notebook in cairo
with the great god from egypt, manifest was write rhymes
align with the stars, i come back to bless the mic


i control the crowd, you know i hold it down
when it drop, you know it's jiggy
when you hear the sound
from town to town, until it's world-renowned
and i rock new york city all year around

i control the crowd, you know i hold it down

You Ain't a Killer|Big Pun|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
the harsh realities of life have taken toll
even jesus christ forsake my soul
please tell me what price to pay to make it whole
take control, i'm makin' dough but not enough to blow
jo's, they lust my flows, but ayo, i don't trust a soul
that's all i know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you
halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
i'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
then i'll stomp your corpse
it's the bronx of course, recognize the accent
one of the last livin' still-in-action general assassins
catchin' any wreck, blastin' any tec, smashin' any chest
passin' any test; charles manson in the flesh
any last requests before you meet your maker?
sow what you reap or wake up
shakin' up a storm, like anita baker
i'll take you straight to hell and fill your heart with hate
incarcerate your fate in satan's fiery lake, then i lock the gate
make no mistake, this shit as real as joe
we follow the killer's code
when we come for you, tell me: where will you go?
nowhere to run, hide, i'll find you and silence your screams
and even if you kill me, i'll still be in your fuckin' dreams


you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat


you've made a grave mistake
shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
your brains'll make their debut on the table
when i raise the stakes
the pain is great, but only for a second
it starts strong, then lessens
just when you restin', the armaggedon sets in
left him with so much stress (t.s.)
blessed him with no regrets, yes
welcome to hell, son, the threshold of death
face the serpent, i blaze your person
you get laced for certain, leavin' jakes no trace to work from
close the case like curtains
i'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryin' to bring the pain
there's nothin' more satisfyin'
than when you cryin', screamin' my name
it's not a game, it's purple rain, floods of bloodstains
big pun's my thug's name
bustin' my guns, that's my love thang
i'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your adam's apple
john madden-tackle your corpse
to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
that'll have to hurt, i'll work your body 'til it burst
then curse tu vida like a brujería verse
i'm worse than anything you ever been through
sick in the head and mental
essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
when you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
fakin' like you satan, when i'm the rhymin' abomination


you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat


it's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
we recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
we read 'em and see 'em for what they are
d's in undercover cars
takin' my picture like i'm a fuckin' star
i'm up to par, my game is in a smash
with half a million in the stash
passport with the gats, first name and last
ask anybody if my men are rowdy
give me the mini-shottie
i'll body a nigga for a penny probably
i'm obligated to anything if it's crime-related
if it shine, i'll take it; still in my prime and i finally made it
i hate the fact that i'm the last edition
properly a stats magician
could've went to college and been a mathematician
bad decisions kept me out the game
now i'm strictly out for cream
doin' things to fiends i doubt you'll ever dream
my team's the meanest thing you ever seen
measured by the heaven's kings
down to the devil's mezzanine
i've never screamed so loud, i'm proud to be alive
most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five
so be advised: the street's full of surprises
it's not what crew's the livest
one that survive, it's who's the wisest


you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk

Remember the Name (feat. Styles of Beyond)|Fort Minor|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
you ready? let's go!
yeah!
for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
it's like this, y'all, c'mon!


this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name


mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
he just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
he feels so unlike everybody else, alone
in spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him

but fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
it's all about reality and making some noise
making a story, making sure his clique stays up
that means when he puts it down, tak's pickin' it up, let's go


who the hell is he, anyway? he never really talks much
never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
that many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps

put it together himself, now the picture connects
never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
he's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
and now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist


this is twenty percent skill, eighty percent fear
be a hundred percent clear, 'cause ryu is ill
who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
and i heard him wreck it with the crystal method
""name of the game""

came back, dropped megadef, took 'em to church
i like ""bleach"", man, ryu had the stupidest verse
this dude is the truth, now, everybody givin' him guest spots
his stock's through the roof, i heard he fuckin' with s. dot


this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name


they call him ryu the sick, and he's spittin' fire with mike
got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in fort minor with tak
what a fucking nihilist, porcupine--he's a prick, he's a cock
the type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot

eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
now, the record with shinoda's taking over the globe
he's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
you won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat


tak, he's not your everyday on the block
he knows how to work with what he's got
making his way to the top
he often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""

no, he's living proof, got him rocking the booth
he'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
him and his crew are known around as one of the best
dedicated to what they doing, give a hundred percent


forget mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
it seems like he's never got time
because he writes every note and he writes every line
and i've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind

it's like a design is written in his head, every time
before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
and those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?


this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name

this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name


yeah! fort minor, m. shinoda, styles of beyond
ryu, takbir, machine shop!"

MC's Act Like They Don't Know|KRS-One|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
'cause i'm krs and i'm on the mic, and premier's on the breaks
goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
of course we don't flip flop


if you don't know me by now i doubt you'll ever know me
i never won a grammy, i won't win a tony
but i'm not the only mc keepin' it real
when i grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""ill""
check the time as i rhyme, it's 1995
whenever i arrive the party gets liver
flow with the master rhymer, as i leave behind
the video rapper, you know, the chart climber
clapper, down goes another rapper
onto another matter, punch up the data, blastmaster
knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everybody
call up krs, i'm guaranteed to rip a party
flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
there once was a story about a man named jed
but now jed is dead, all his kids instead
want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
word, what go around come around i figure
now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
the tables turned as the crosses burned
remember you must learn
about the styles i flip and how wild i get
i go on like a space age rocket ship
you could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
but make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer


mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know


this is what you waited all year for
the hardcore, that's what krs is here for
big up grand wizard theodore, gettin' ill
if you see then ya saw i'm in your grill with mad skill
mc's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
let's battle to see who headlines
instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
too many mc's take that word 'emcee' lightly
they can't move a crowd, not even slightly
it might be the fact that they express wackness
let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
i flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
now tone it down a bit
my title you will never get, i'm too intelligent
i'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
when i rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, i knock it
it split quick from the lyric
direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it


mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know


some mc's don't like the krs but they must respect him
cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
i design rhyme and get mine all the time
mc's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
when i roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
i don't burn, i don't freeze, yet some mc's
believe they could tango with the likes of these
cross your t's and dot your i's whenever i arrive
wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
you dope, you lied, i reside like artifacts
on the wrong side of da tracks, electrified
comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
as i spark mad izm
the 1996 lyrical style's what i give 'em


mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know
mcs act like they don't know"

When I'm Gone|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yeah, it's my life
in my own words, i guess


have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
when they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""daddy, look what i made!"" ""dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""daddy, where's mommy? i can't find mommy, where is she?""
""i don't know, go play, hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
i'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah, baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rock-a-bye baby


and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
i'm lookin' down on you smilin' and i didn't feel a thing
so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
i'm lookin' down on you smilin' and i didn't feel a thing
so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back


i keep havin' this dream, i'm pushin' hailie on the swing
she keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""you're makin' mommy cry, why? why is mommy cryin'?""
""baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""daddy, you're lyin'!
you always say that, you always say this is the last time
but you ain't leavin' no more, daddy, you're mine!""
she's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""daddy, please! daddy, don't leave! daddy, no, stop it!""
goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
it's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe, daddy, take it with ya!""
i look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
these fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, i can hear 'em
they're sayin', ""you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and i'm singin'

sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
the curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
i take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
they're screamin' so loud, i take one last look at the crowd
i glance down, i don't believe what i'm seein'
""daddy, it's me! help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
but baby, we're in sweden, how did you get to sweden?
""i followed you, daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
you lied to me, dad, and now you made mommy sad
and i bought you this coin, it says 'number one dad'
that's all i wanted, i just wanna give you this coin
i get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'.""
but baby, wait! – ""it's too late, dad, you made the choice
now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
that's what they want, they want you, marshall, they keep
screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
just take another pill, yeah, i bet you you will
you rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
i hear applause, all this time i couldn't see
how could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
i turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
put it to my brain, scream, ""die, shady!"" and pop it
the sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that i was
supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
that's when i wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
it's spring and hailie's outside swingin'
i walk right up to kim and kiss her, tell her i miss her
hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say


and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
i'm lookin' down on you smilin' and i didn't feel a thing

poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
it be the inspectah deck on the warpath
first class, leaving mics with a cast
causing ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
rhymes running wild like a child in a walker
i scored from the inner slums abroad
and my thoughts are razor sharp, i sliced the mic from the cord
first to criticize, but now they have become
mentally paralyzed with hits that i devise
now i testify, the best is i
rebel ins your highness, blessed to electrify
with voltage of a eel, truth that i reveal
will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
part time minor leagues receive third degrees
attack like a wolf pack once i pull back
the god-u and bust through like a fullback


yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
tapping inside my rap vein causes blizzards
the wildlife that kills for ice trife like by the digits
gorillas injected with strength of eighty ninjas
the earth spins, whirlwinds, rap exotic blends
let my peeps in, niggas gasping, swallowing aspirins
with a dosage, you overdosed in rap
high explosives, my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
i sell goods, my whole clan is on the run like natural born killers
record-breaking the album thriller
got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
flow like dough, killa beez is what i sponsor
your entrepreneur, pens in gear like shakespeare
when i fuck i grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
fuck yeah, my crew down german beers
my career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs
etcetera, damage any lame-ass competitor
who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
whatever hot hard-heads get shattered like mirrors
beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
flew my family overseas, i'm maxin'
if rap was crack, fully packed i be tall cats
taxin' kingpin of the rap drug traffickin'
fearless niggas get slapped in manhattan
for rappin', big ghost steps off laughin'

""were you just using the wu-tang school method against me?""
""i've learned so many styles, forgive me""


sit back, relax, fake niggas don't get turns
watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
projects filled with young men cause threats
who has that? thousand dollar chains and tecs
focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
these mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit
exchange mad blunts, taste the sweepstakes
keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes
no doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off
putting fifty on the land and allah, it's like that
pull ya shoes up black, matter of fact just adapt
tie up, your black nikes and tight hats
corners stay surrounded with foreigners
what up, dread? feds caught your bredren for his bread
but regardless, peace to jail niggas with charges
unify laying in the yard with la
my clan done ran from japan to atlanta with stamina
slingers and gamblers and gram handlers
tical light the owl cigar, let's get steamed
infra-red guard your beam, so seek nuff respect
rude bwoy you bet, keep it moving, mashallah, pro black like tar
designing the fly shit and stay shining
the rza pour more beats than cristal's fine wine
concrete raps go to bat
with 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
knew it's all good and all done what, we want son
mike tyson of this rap shit, pulling out macs for fun


the nigga don't get mad, i got mad styles of my own
and it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
verbally, i catch bodies with cordless shotties
intriguing mcs, i keep em trained like potties
i bomb facts, my sword is an axe
to split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
sky's the limit, niggas are timid
and nobody knows how we move like wolves in sheep clothes
producing data, microchips of software, underground and off-air
the land of the lost, notorious henchman from the north
striking niggas where the mason-dixon line cross"
Ain't No Half-Steppin'|Big Daddy Kane|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
mmm, mmm, mmm
aw yea, i'm with this
i'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
and drop some smooth lyrics cause '88
time to set it straight, know what i'm saying?
and ain't no half stepping
word, i'm ready


rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
but i'm the kane, so yo, you know the outcome
another victory, they can't get with me
so pick a b.c. date cause you are history
i'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
for you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
and stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
so what you on, hobbs, dope or dog food?
competition, i just devour
like a pit bull against a chihuahua
cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
i got it good, now let me tell you who i am
the b-i-g d-a-double-d-y k-a-n-e
dramatic, asiatic, not like many
i'm different, so don't compare me to another
cause they can't hang, word to the mother
at least not with the principal in this pedigree
so when i roll on you rappers, you better be
ready to die because you're petty
you're just a butter knife, i'm a machete
that's made by ginsu, wait until when you
try to front, so i can chop into
your body, just because you try to be basing
friday the 13th, i'ma play jason
no type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
the name is big daddy, yes, big—not little
so define it, here's your walking papers, sign it
and take a walk as the kane start to talk, cause


ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
""down the road""


my rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hoping
to sound like me, so soon i'll have to open
a school of emceeing, for those who want to be in
my field in court, then again on second thought
to have emcees coming out sounding so similar
it's quite confusing for you to remember
the originator, and boy do i hate a
perpetrator, but i'm much greater
the best, oh yes, i guess suggest the rest should fess
don't mess or test your highness
unless you just address with best finesse
and bless the paragraph i manifest
rap prime minister, some say sinister
non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
climax, and i max, relax and chill
have a break from a take of me acting ill
brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
next the formation of words that fit
at the table i sit, making it legit
and when my pen hits the paper, ah shit
i stop and stand strong over emcees
and devour with the power of hercules
or samson, but i go further the length
cause you could scalp my cameo and i'll still have strength
and no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
your vocab, i'll only ignore
be sleeping on your rhymes till i start to snore
you can't awake me, or even make me
fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
so, think about it if you're trying to go
when you want to step to me, i think you should know that


ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
""down the road""


i appear right here and scare and dare
a mere musketeer that would dare to compare
put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
so on to be want to be competition
trying to step to me, must be on a mission
up on the stage is where i'ma get you at
you think i'm losing? pfft, picture that


ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
ain't no half-steppin'
i'm the big daddy kane
mister cee, step to me


the name is big daddy, you know, as in, your father
so when you hear a def rhyme, believe that i'm the author
i grab the mic and make emcees evaporate
the party people say, 'damn, that rapper's great'
the creator, conductor of poetry
et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
i speak clearly so you can understand
put words together like letter man
now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
not like the other emcees that are an imitation
or an animation, a cartoon to me
but when i'm finished, i'm sure that you are soon to see
reality, my secret technique
because i always speak with mentality
i put my title in your face, dare you to base
and if you try and come get it, yo i'ma show you who's with it
so if you know like i know, instead of messing around
play like roy rogers and slow down
just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
your title, namely me, cause i'm homicidal
that means murder, cause i'm about to hurt a-
nother emcee, that try to get with me
i'll just break him and bake him and rake him
and take him and mold him and make him
hold up the peace sign, as salaam alaikum!"
My Band|D12|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i don't know, dude
i think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘cause i'm like the lead singer of the band, dude
and i think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
and they need to take it up with me after the show, because…


these chicks don't even know the name of my band
but they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘cause once i blow they know that i'll be the man
all because i'm the lead singer of my band


so i get off stage, right, drop the mic
walk up to these hot chicks and i'm all like
""sup? ladies, my name's slim shady
i'm the lead singer in d12, baby""
they're all like, ""oh my god, it's him
becky, oh my fucking god, it's eminem
i swear to fucking god, dude, you fucking rock
please marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
and by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
especially when i drop the beat and do my a cappellas
all the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
so like every single night they pick a fight with me
but when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘cause they're back on stage the next night with me
dude! i just think you're trying to steal the light from me
yesterday kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘cause i told him jessica alba's my wife-to-be
this rock star shit, it's the life for me
and all the other guys just despise me, because these…


these chicks don't even know the name of my band
but they're all on me like they wanna hold hands

but we in the van and he in a tour bus
you don't want my autograph, you's a liar
and no, i'm swift (oh, i thought you were kuniva)
what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
‘cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
see, i know how to rap, it's simple, but
all i did was read a russell simmons book
so i'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back


look at em's little punk ass thinking he the shit
yeah, i know, man, by himself taking all the flicks
hey, i thought we had an interview with dj clue
(no, i had an interview, not you two)

these chicks don't even know the name of my band
but they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘cause once i blow they know that i'll be the man
all because i'm the lead singer of my band


they say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
i'm gon' let the world know that proof is hot
i should cut his mic off when the music starts
(ayo, it's…) ready to snap on a dumbass fan
every time i hear (hey, dude, i love your band!)
we ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
so why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
and these guys acting funny every area code
(proof, carry my bag!) bitch, carry your own!
can't make it to the stage, security in my way
who the fuck are you? where's obie and dre?!


god damn it, i'm sick of this group
time for me to go solo and make some loot
i told you i made the beats and wrote all the raps
till kon artis slipped me some crack
""lose yourself"" video – i was in the back
""superman"" video – i was in the back
for the media i got some suggestions
fuck marshall! ask us the questions!
like ""who's d12? how we get started?""
(but what about eminem?) bitch, are you retarded?!
anyway, i'm the popularest guy in the group
big ass stomach, bitches think i'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
did two and a half and couldn't get up

and it just tears my ass apart
to know that you don't know my name

see, i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
the same dude you gave nothin', i made somethin' doin'
what i do, through and through and
i give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade, you been afraid i penetrate pop culture
bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
and they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
from botched robberies, niggas crouched over
mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
""no, he's not around."" now, how that sound to ya? jot it down
i bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
i help them see they way through it—not you
can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt


since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i ain't no politician, but i'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, i'll wear it
but if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
but there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
nah, nah!—that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
and i got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (ha-ha!)
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here?
i don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘cause, here we go; he's jigga-jur-jigga-jih-jigga
and i'm the sinister mr. kiss-my-ass is just a—

pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
what you hollerin'? gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
by the bodega, iron under my coat
feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
do not step to me, i'm awkward, i box lefty
an orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
could not stress to me, i wasn't grown
'specially on nights i brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor, thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
big, i did it, multi before i die
no lie, just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight


see, i'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day shakespeare
jesus christ, the king of these latter-day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
but that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""dixie""
while i'm wavin' the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons, take a bath with the catholics
in holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
i'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
the new ice cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
what did i do? (huh?) i'm just a kid from the gutter
makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause i'm a muh'fuckin'—

navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
and i hate to tell you too much, cuz i stay with too much pride
and we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
don't believe in love at first sight, but i believe in love at first huh
can i be with you just one night, i could wear you out inside
i could tell you like persistence, but i make you cum in tri's
i just think we need one night, can't decide if i came right
easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
i ain't thinking i ain't right, can't decide but i can't fight
easy baby, you the bomb and all, but i be damned if i do not land mine
or at least try, can i speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
can we take shots? what's your flavor? flat drinks we call a cups
i just think i need one night, slightly more if it's done right
with that gorgeous face, i don't know your name, it ain't important babe 'cause i'ma call you mine


we're living in a fantasy
i feel it when you dance with me
it's feeling like you need to be
my lady, my baby, yeah
can't you see
i'm talking about eternity
tell me would you care to be
my lady, my baby


'cause i don’t know you, you don’t know me
the clock keeps ticking baby what's it gonna be
i don’t know you, you don’t know me
let me teach you all the sounds of love


ahhhh, ayyyyy, eeeeee, ahh ohh ooo
baby this was for you, lotus"

see i was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed
to feed my female, a-s-a-p
nature is a mother
and life is a bitch, i am convinced
god comin', she just takin' her time
god comin', she just takin' her time (ayy!)
god comin', she just takin' her time
god comin', she just takin' her time (ayy!)
take your time, baby!


i get the feelin' that you only playin' hard to get
‘cause you ain't forget how much i love a challenge
i know we were divided to restore the balance
hope i still get you wet while you bendin' over backwards
watchin' over me in ecstacy, expectin' me
your number is 6 and 50 interestingly
i hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries
on your tippy toes for me, just how you 'posed to be
they spoke of us in cairo quite some time ago
how these adamines adapt to this is incredible
they love to go to sleep but hate to be awake
treat the eye of horus as if it's just a symbol
unattainable, they read the wrong rights
they see the signs but ain't see what the sign saw
but luckily, uh, love is the only law, uh
love is the, love is the only…

god comin', she just takin' her time
take your time, baby!


love, love
‘cause all my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
and you the only one that know what i mean
you know what i mean


and they say our separation was sacrificial and all
but i'm in awe
these hybrids gettin' high, but they don't get it at all
the pain of division is nothin'
the joy of disillusion is all, but all in all, man
i know you a modest scarlet woman
like to say you everything but nothin'
but you nothin' but my everything
how shall i explain? ayy, mac


see i was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed

one time for the women
two times for the ladies
three times for the bitches
can't forget about the queen


queens, we are noddin' back
understand we are his back
and when he puts the arc in your back
understand that we took him to heaven
where those golden arcs are at
golden as sundrops, queen
when he looks in your eyes
you show him where the stars are at
and your beautiful, beautiful darkness
and in return he replies that
""girl, i'll be your knight, your knight in shining armor
‘cause you're my heart, queen""
and lying on his chest our hearts beat box
and you and i are queens
we remind him that he can be all ours
‘cause we all gods
and god is queen and god is love
and love stays above all

Halftime|Nas|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


(right… right…)
check me out y'all
nasty nas in your area
about to cause mass hysteria


before a blunt, i take out my fronts
then i start to front, matter of fact i be on a manhunt
you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
that's like malcolm x catchin' the jungle fever
king poetic, too much flavor, i'm major
atlanta ain't brave-r, i'll pull a number like a pager
‘cause i'm an ace when i face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
now wait, another dose and you might be dead
and i'm a nike-head, i wear chains that excite the feds
and ain't a damn thing gonna change, i'm a performer, strange
so the mic warmer was born to gain
nas, why did you do it?
you know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
it's halftime


(right…) it's halftime
(right…) ayo it's halftime
(right…) it's halftime
(right…) yeah, it's about halftime
this is how it feel, check it out, how it feel


it's like that, you know it's like that
i got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
when i attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
so i react never calmly on a hype track
i set it off with my own rhyme
‘cause i'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
i'm max like cassettes, i flex like sex
in your stereo sets, nas'll catch wreck
i used to hustle, now all i do is relax and strive
when i was young i was a fan of the jackson 5
i drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
with more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
nasty nas has to rise ‘cause i'm wise
this is exercise 'til the microphone dies
back in '83 i was an mc sparkin'
but i was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
kick my little raps ‘cause i thought niggas wouldn't understand
and now in every jam i'm the fuckin' man
i rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
i used to watch ""chips"", now i load glock clips
i got to have it, i miss mr. magic
versatile, my style switches like a faggot
but not bisexual, i'm an intellectual
of rap i'm a professional, and that's no question yo
these are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘cause in the streets i'm well-known like the number man
am i in place with the bass and format?
explore rap and tell me, ""nas ain't all that""
and next time i rhyme, i be foul
whenever i freestyle i see trial, niggas say i'm wild
i hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
stay tuned, i assume, the real rap comes at halftime


(right…) it's halftime
(right…) exhale, check it, it's halftime
(right…) it's halftime
(right…) it's real in the field
word life, check it


i got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
every afternoon, i kick half the tune
and in the darkness i'm heartless like when the narc's hit
word to marcus garvey, i hardly sparked it
‘cause when i blast the herb, that's my word
i be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third
but chill, pass the andre, and let's slay
i bag bitches up at john jay and hit a matinee
puttin' hits on 5-0
‘cause when it's my time to go, i wait for god with the .44
and biters can't come near
and yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot garcia
i won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth i can't feed
that's extra phillie change, more cash for damp weed
this goes out to manhattan, the island of staten
brooklyn and queens is livin' fat and
the boogie down, enough props, enough clout
ill will, rest in peace, yo i'm out


(right…) it's still halftime
(right…) to the queensbridge crew
to the queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(right…) '92, it's halftime
(right…) yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
halftime…"
Dusted 'N' Disgusted (feat. 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1)|E-40|hip-hop-rap-trap|"

takin' a nigga's shit (ayy, put that on somethin')
i put that on the click, the click
back to fuckin' work, one of the homies just got dusted
time to do some dirt, uh, i never trusted them bustas
shot him in the shirt, dead on arrival
now the town is funkin', it's called survival
what y'all wanna do? they got us skunked
(well if, uh, we can just, uh—)
if it was a fifth, we'll all be drunk
i'm heated, them niggas cheated, played me false
we had a meetin', shit 'posed to been squashed
i noticed one killer on the double dribble and set him up, y'all
she likes the monie in the middle, play tetherball
thick-ass bitch, high yellow city-slicker
scarecrow creepin' southern bitches, a.k.a. posie pussyfictitious


nigga been holdin' guts
but shit on hisself and a funky bill
pullin' out bills, frontin' on material shit
that's when i get to killin' shit (killin' shit)
and settin' him up and havin him catchin' a couple of slugs
slu–uh–slu–uh–slugs
tryna fuck with savage thug
pistol pop in they ass
see, niggas be gettin' this twisted
it's that bitch that killed ya
took all your money, peeled ya
seven niggas bust in the room with aks
while a nigga be puttin' on his jimmy
all of a sudden they shoot up your nutsack
before you can hit the broccoli
see money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
left them niggas jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
he's a busta, punk ass nigga, don't know the streets
that's why that nigga naked layin' dead in between some bloody sheets
it's just a part of the game he didn't feel
bitches will kill, fuck a nigga, out his last d-uh dollar bill
you don't know that ho, mayne, that bitch can't be trusted
dusted and di-motherfuckin'-sgusted

let's let off some 2o3s on the other side of t-uh-town
draw the attention on the other s-uh-side of town (other side of town)
and wait for the po-po shift to change, ghetto shootin' range
revenge on the r-uh-rebound, war games
droughts, ouch, lost clientele but i will prevail
by sellin' the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine trumps
that steal narcotics
when it's funkin' season, bitches be the reason
why the smoke be coming up out the chop, with my nigga 'pac


dear god, can you forgive me? my future's lookin' sick
i'm in my rag hittin' switches, i'm suspicious of these bitches
i keep on, calllin', but ain't nobody pickin' up
i think she's stallin', this evil bitch is tryin' to set me up
came all alone—if it's on, then it's on
bust my motherfuckin' chrome, on these jealous niggas' dome
it's a war zone (war zone) but i'm a man, so with gun in hand
i'm on my way to see this ho', you know the fuckin' plan
can't understand, but the things ain't the same
you could die over these bitches if you slippin' in the game
niggas gangbang, but bitches gangbang too
give up that good thang, when i put that pistol to your brain
if you a smart figure, don't have no love in your heart, nigga
any complications, pull the trigger

They Reminisce over You|Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


(i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)
i reminisce, i reminisce
uh! (i reminisce, i reminisce)
yeah (i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)
(i reminisce, i reminisce)


i reminisce for a spell, or shall i say think back
twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
the birth of a child on the 8th of october
a toast, but my granddaddy came sober
countin' all the fingers and the toes
now i suppose you hope the little black boy grows
huh, eighteen years younger than my mama
but i rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama
in single parenthood, there i stood
by the time she was 21, had another one
this one's a girl, let's name her pam
same father as the first, but you don't give a damn
irresponsible, plain not-thinking
papa said chill but the brother keep winking
still he won't down you or tear out your hide
on your side while the baby maker slide
but mama got wise to the game
the youngest of five kids, hon here it is
after 10 years without no spouse
momma's gettin married in the house
listen, positive over negative for the women and master
mother queen's rising a chapter
déjà vu, tell you what i'm gonna do
when they reminisce over you, my god


my god
it's so
yeah, so lovely
that's how we like to do it in the 90's
pete rock & cl smooth comin' atcha


when i date back i recall a man off the family tree
my right hand poppa doc i see
took me from a boy to a man so i always had a father
when my biological didn't bother
taking care of this, so who am i to bicker
not a bad ticker but i'm clocking pop's liver
but you can never say that his life is through
five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
here we go while i check the scene
with the portuguese lover at the age of 14
the same age, front page, no fuss
but i bet you all your dough they live longer than us
never been senile, that's where you're wrong
but give the man a taste and he's gone
noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
i can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
i get the pillow and hope i don't wake him
for this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
i said pop maybe when you're older
we laughed all night about the hookers at the party
my old man standing, yelling ""good god almighty""
use your condom, take sips of the brew
when they reminisce over you, for real


for real, baby
like that
we for real
comin' atcha
in '92
pete rock & cl smooth
yeah, c'mon, hit me!


i reminisce so you never forget this
the days of way-back, so many bear witness the fitness
take the first letter out of each word in this joint
listen close as i prove my point
t to the r the o-y, how did you and i meet?
in front of big lou's, fighting in the street
but only you saw what took many time to see
i dedicate this to you for believing in me
rain or shine, yes, in any weather
my grandmom pam holds the family together
my uncle doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
if we're talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
i strive to be live 'cause i got no choice
and run my own business like my aunt joyce
so pete rock hit me, 'nough respect due
when they reminisce over you, listen


listen, just listen
to the funky song as i rock on
and that's word is bond
i'm not playin'
everybody, just coolin'
this song we dedicate
to the one and only
never be another
he was my brother
trouble t-roy
it's like that y'all
and you don't stop
pete rock and cl smooth for '92
and we out, later"

Album of the Year|J. Cole|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yeah
my mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
higher than average
lot of cabbage
thank god i never abide by the established
guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
commissioned by the state, i skate by the masters
like ""yoo-hoo"" with a new-new ridin' passenger
shout out oak cliff, i'm 'bout to fly to dallas
decade from now i might just buy the mavericks
what up, mark cuban?
i am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
plus, i'm good at math like i'm asian
hate to use stereotypes—but that's light compared to what a nigga get from caucasians
no race-baitin'—treat the beat like playstation
reporting to you live from the international space station
i probably vacation on mars
the flow is out of this world and so is the bars
blow the facade right off of your squad
lil' rappers, i love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in prague
look that shit up
a book, nigga, pick that shit up
expand your vocab
i'm giving out toe tags for no cash
all summer long plus three seasons after
please cc a rapper, tell him meet me
it's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
the problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
i'm the answer on the low, i'm a cheat sheet for rappers
i came up 'round ac to dc adapters
plug talk, what i'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like hbcu kappas
whole town full of cc sabathia's
you think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
not really
this is not the eighties, don't be silly
now we push pills and sell heroin to billy
now billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
how many black addicts that got caught up in the system
with no sob stories on your prime time television, i can smell a blatant contradiction
man, listen
don't want to fuck up my vibe
let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
kod—album of the year, undebatably
my cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late mc whose name was the notorious—
dreamville stacked like the warriors
winning back to back
next up to bat is my nigga, bas
after that, jiddy-j.i.d
that's that new york city kid plus atl
me, i'm from the 'ville, but i know them towns well
before i had a deal i was givin' niggas hell
now i'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell"

Cleanin' Out My Closet|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
where's my snare?
i have no snare in my headphones
there you go, yeah, yo, yo


have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
i have—i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
all this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as i'm breathin'
keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
look at me now! i bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
ain't you, mama? i'ma make you look so ridiculous now!


i'm sorry, mama, i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet (one more time!)
i said i'm sorry, mama, i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet (ha!)


i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it; i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multi-platinum-selling cd
i was a baby, maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘cause he split, i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no, i don't, on second thought, i just fuckin' wished he would die
i look at hailie, and i couldn't picture leavin' her side
even if i hated kim, i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human, but i'm man enough to face 'em today
what i did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘cause i'da killed 'em, shit, i woulda shot kim and him both
it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show


i'm sorry, mama, i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet (one more time!)
i said i'm sorry, mama, i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet (uh)


now, i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
but put yourself in my position, just try to envision
witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
goin' through public housing systems
victim of münchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up, now i blew up
it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me, ma?
so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
but guess what, you're gettin' older now
and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growin' up so quick
he's gonna know that you're phony
and hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
but you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
see, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
you selfish bitch, i hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
well, guess what, i am dead—dead to you as can be!


i'm sorry, mama, i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet (one more time!)
i said i'm sorry, mama, i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet"

and peace to this young warrior

if i could recollect before my hood days
i sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
i stop and stare at the younger
my heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
and nowadays things change
everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
and for me it's reversed
we left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘cause any day they'll push the button
and all good men like malcolm x or bobby hutton died for nothin'
don't it make you get teary? the world looks dreary
when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
there's no need for you to fear me
if you take your time to hear me
maybe you can learn to cheer me
it ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
i hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

i welcome with my hands

tell me, do you see that old lady? ain't it sad?
livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
and over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
i don't trip or let it fade me
from out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
even now i get discouraged
wonder, if they take it all back, will i still keep the courage?
i refuse to be a role model
i set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
i make mistakes but learn from every one
and when it's said and done, i bet this brother be a better one
if i upset you, don't stress
never forget that god isn't finished with me yet
i feel his hand on my brain
when i write rhymes i go blind and let the lord do his thang
but am i less holy
'cause i chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
before we find world peace
we gotta find peace and end the war in the streets

drop!


let me freak the funk, obsolete is the punk
that talks more junk than sanford sells
i jet propel at a rate, that complicate their mental state
as i invade their masquerade, they couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
i let you take a swing, and you bunted for an easy out
i leave emcees with doubt of exceeding
my name is bootie brown and i'm proceeding, leading
they try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
i can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle of o.e
they have no key or no clue
to the game at all, now they washed up
hung out to dry
stand there looking stupid, wondering why
(why man?)
it was the fame, that they tried to get
now they walking around talkin' about represent
and keep it real, but i got to appeal
'cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel


drop!


rock-a-bye baby
listen to your heartbeat pumping to a fine
ravine of all things it's a vain of a shrine
all missions impossible are possible, 'cause i'm
headed for a new sector 365
days from now, i'll wipe the sweat from my eye
and each and every true will stick or fall from the skies
of my cloud nine
from homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
you hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
and the world's at a standstill, deep in broken-man's-ville
trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
killing yourself, and dogging ya health
you ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself


(shit is-shit is ill)
but through my will, my flow still will spill
toxic slick to shock sick like electrocute
when i execute acutely over the rhythm
on those that pollute, extra dosages is what i gotta give 'em
got 'em mad and tremblin'
'cause i been up in my lab assemblin'
missiles to bomb the enemy
because they envy me and the making of my mad currency
currently i think we're in a state of an emergency
'cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
and i think they can't follow
they can't swallow the truth because it hurts
this is how i put it down, this is my earth, my turf
the worth of my birth is a billion
and you know what time it is i'm gonna make a million

sip some bacardi then go pull up at the after party
i think we make a perfect couple, but you think i'm trouble
maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
she got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
think i'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
and your gucci boots the same color as mine
if you read between the lines you can see that i want you
i betcha i'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
before i head home i'ma stop at your house and blow the horn

lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why i don't call her
maybe because i'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
it gets annoying, from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
she loves it when i'm in town, hate it when i'm not around
i get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
i'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call my by my government name
her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
i wonder if i wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my on-ly
i'm not your boyfriend, i'm your ho-mie


i wanna get to know ya
i really wanna fuck you, baby
one dose of your loving
i know it gon' drive me, crazy

yeah..
don't know what fuck me up more: watching her lick her lips
or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
i sweet talk her if she like
'cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
look, i'm legit now, i used to break laws
now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
big house, big benz - girl it's yours
mink coats, italian shoes, stones with no flaws
you ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
all you gotta do is love me and be loyal
don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
come here, let me touch on you, i let you touch on me
put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
let me ride on you, and you can ride on
we can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight


i wanna get to know ya

she had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
i was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
but a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘cause when i seen them thighs on her
and them hips on her and them lips on her
got me daydreamin', man, what

make it hard for me to stand up
as time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
wet dreamin', thinkin' that i'm smashin' but i'm sleepin'
i want it bad, and i ain't never been obsessed before
she wrote a note that said, ""you ever had sex before?""

and i ain't never did this before, nooo
i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no
and i ain't never did this before, no


i wrote back and said
""of course i had sex before,"" knowin' i was frontin'
i said, ""i'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' i was stuntin'
but if i told the truth, i knew that i'd get played out, son
hadn't been in pussy since the day i came out one
but she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""oh, you a pro, homie? well, i want you to show me
my mama gone for the weekend
so saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
that's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
baby, you done woke my lil' man up
i'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
teacher, please, don't make me stand up
i wrote back like, ""yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
but i was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
talkin' shit, knowin' damn well i was a virgin
fuck…

i'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
i'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
and most of all i'm prayin', ""god, don't let me bust quick!""
i'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
i'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
with a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
that's when my hands start touchin'
and her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
and then she get my pants unbuckled
and her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
it's time for action
pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how i practiced
but right before i put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
and said, ""i wanna get somethin' off my mental
i can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""

and with me up on them beats
then we shared the same description
with a blunt between her lips, she said
""now here's my proposition:

we was swervin', jumped the curb
and ditched the whip and started runnin'
tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
so we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
i was shook and breathin' hard
and she was sittin' there smokin' kush
then we both started to glow, we looked around like, ""what is this?""
and then we looked up and a light

i slap your lip, so you talk sideways like sly stallone
face the truth, my fists are guided to knock your left tooth
lyrically, ya moms rhymes better than you and she's deaf mute
step two times to the left, throw up ya fists
direct 'em towards those wack mc's please as i reminisce
you might have more dollars than you have common sense
the lp's stand ground like hercules

it's similar to vietnam
now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
they better have the riot gear ready

by the mac one-double, i touch you
and leave you with not much to go home with
my skin is thick, ‘cause i be up in the mix of action
if i'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
new york got a nigga depressed
so i wear a slug-proof underneath my guess
god bless my soul
before i put my foot down and begin to stroll
into the drama i built
and all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
i'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
and if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
lord, forgive me

when you're upstate bleedin'
you can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
hit with a two to four is difficult
wild on the streets, i try to maintain
tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
some niggas like to trick, but i ain't with that trickin' shit

187's in the hood, i can't say shit
one-time thinkin' it was premeditated

to live the atheist life that i was brainwashed to know
niggas run up every day, wantin' to get some
i told them who runs the motherfucker flow and then some
win some, lose some, like a nightmare
i got enough shit on my mind, i just can't care
i'm on the run, runnin' from who's-ever gun is aimin'
i'm all up in the middle of shit and ain't even claimin'
tryin' to survive in the hood is hard enough
cause them niggas already thinkin' i'm claimin' creek mobb
trippin' on gettin' snuffed by the view, smoke in the gardens
stayin' out the creek, cause it's hot and hella hard to get
a dub up without gettin' caught, and them niggas know it
drinkin' that 4-0 ounce, in case i'm shot, i wanna be drunk
and don't feel it, that nigga, that nigga that raised the shit
raised a crip, but really can't fade the shit no more

young nigga, i wish i coulda told him what was up
fuckin' with the so-called devil will get you fucked
i woulda told him, that nigga, he killin' the bitches all the time
but never knew that nigga would murder and try to ditch a crime

is every fool that deals with the devil is through
me, i'm a psycho, me mama might go ill when she find out
her baby's makin' criminals, that nigga, that mic' man critical
that nigga that lynched, that critical criminal hinges on the loose

it's x-raided, he made it to the hood, nigga, where you at?
that nigga said, ""'round the corner at the pay phone""
""i got the dank, i got the crew and the nine, loc, you know it's on""

but when it comes to trustin' niggas, i can't fade it
frontin' niggas like a game, so i played it
half-dead fools got me gang-related
a new nigga wanna kill me every day, shit
for every nigga that pull a glock on me
i'm not dyin', nigga, that's not gon' be
i keep tryin' to get myself up out this shit
but all the niggas i know still gon' be claimin' me crip
i'm not trippin', whenever they want the flow, they go

like 69 billion in the last 20 years
spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
like nearly half of america's largest cities is one-quarter black
that's why they gave ricky ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
a 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of americans own a cell phone
so they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
i guess michael jackson was right, you are not alone
rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the terrordome
full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
crack mothers, crack babies, and aids patients
young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in playstation
this new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
you want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
it's mathematics

yo, it's 1 universal law, but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you biddin' for life, mandatory
4 mcs murdered in the last 4 years
i ain't trying to be the 5th when the millennium is here
yo it's 6 million ways to die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
it's 10 pm, where your seeds at? what's the deal?
he on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
when the average minimum wage is $5.15
you best believe you've got to find a new grind to get cream
the white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
some front-liners got their gun in your back
bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
and end up in the global jail economy
stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
budget cutbacks but increased police presence
and even if you get out of prison still livin'
join the other 5 million under state supervision
this is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
from your phone, your zip code, to ssi digits
the system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for ""who is"" and ""who ain't niggas""
numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
but you push too hard, even numbers got limits
why did one straw break the camel's back?
here's the secret
the million other straws underneath it
it's all mathematics

oaktown, la, san fran, st. john


people give your ears so i be sublime
it's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
sit down, indian style, as we recite these hymns
see, lyrically i'm mario andretti on the momo
ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
heard me in the eighties, j.b.'s on ""the promo""
in my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
but now, let me take it to the queens side
i'm taking it to brooklyn side
all the residential questers who invade the air
hold up a second son, cause we almost there
you can be a black man and lose all your soul
you can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
see my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
or delf or self, see there's no one else
who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
so, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
do that, do that, do that, that, that (ok)
do that, do that, do that, that, that
i'm bugging out but let me get back cause i'm wetting niggas
so run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
i learned how to build mics in my workshop class
so give me this award, and let's not make it the last

back in '89 i simply slid into place
buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
a lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
some said quest was wack, but now is that the case?
i have a quest to have a mic in my hand
without that, it's like kryptonite and superman
so shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
phife dawg's my name, but on stage, call me dynomutt
when was the last time you heard the phife sloppy
lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
top notch baby, never coming less
sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in quest
sit back, relax, get up out the path
if not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
non-believers, you can check the stats
i roll with shaheed and the brother abstract
niggas know the time when quest is in the jam
i never let a statue tell me how nice i am
coming with more hits than the braves and the yankees
living mad phat like an oversized mampi
the wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
when my track record's longer than a dc-20 aircraft
so, next time that you think you want somethin' here
make something def or take that garbage to st. elsewhere

It Was A Good Day|Ice Cube|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


break 'em
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh


just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank god
i don't know, but today seems kinda odd
no barking from the dog, no smog
and momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
i got my grub on, but didn't pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
hooked it up for later as i hit the door
thinkin', ""will i live another 24?""
i gotta go 'cause i got me a drop-top
and if i hit the switch, i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim, and she can fuck all night
called up the homies and i'm askin' y'all
""which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
get me on the court and i'm trouble
last week, fucked around and got a triple double
freakin' niggas every way, like mj
i can't believe today was a good day


drove to the pad and hit the showers
didn't even get no static from the cowards
'cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me
no flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dog's house, they was watchin' yo! mtv raps
what's the haps on the craps?
shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
roll 'em in a circle of niggas
and watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door lil joe
i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones, and i'm yellin': ""domino!""
plus nobody i know got killed in south central la
today was a good day


left my nigga's house paid
picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
it's ironic, i had the brew, she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics
i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
and my dick runs deep, so deep
so deep put her ass to sleep
woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate to call ice cube the top gun
drove her to the pad and i'm coastin'
took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
no helicopter lookin' for a murder
two in the morning, got the fatburger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read ""ice cube's a pimp"" (yeah)
drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
today i didn't even have to use my ak
i gotta say, it was a good day


hey, wait, wait a minute!
pooh, stop this shit!
what the fuck am i thinkin' about?"

the yellow tape surrounds the fate
don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (damn)


ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
open the internet, photosynthesis
put in parentheses, temporary
very scary if i feel like dirty harry
just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
but yet the question is, ""is he fake? is he real?""
what the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
i'ma sever it when i sever shit
i kill 'em, no kony, these niggas ain't homies
claim you the homie, i turn into broly
droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
flow like a foreigner, i'm the torturer
out of south florida, call the coroner
killed in the corridor, i'm the overlord
rhymes like a sorcerer, i'm an animorph
bitch, i'm a beast
nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
k to the i to the n to the g
claim you the hottest, but i disagree
better learn something and get a degree
this for lord infamous, so r.i.p
arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
ending of the story


i am the one, don't weigh a ton
don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (okay)
under the sun, the bastard son
will pop the glock to feed himself and family (sheesh)
by any means, your enemies, my enemies
we wet them up like a canteen (damn)
the yellow tape surrounds the fate
don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates"
Sing For The Moment|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (bitch!)
'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
his step-father hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go


(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away


entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy, only have one homie
only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate (huh-uh)
i guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
from standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
to havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
but then these critics crucify you (yep), journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
so i'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b
it's all political, if my music is literal
and i'm a criminal, how the fuck can i raise a little girl?
i couldn't, i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too, guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (bitch!)


(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (sing that shit!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away


they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
we entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
you ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
we just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up, ain't it? how we can come from practically nothin'
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (ha-ha!)
who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…


sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away


sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)

Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe|Kendrick Lamar|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord, forgive me! lord, forgive me!
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe!
bitch, don't kill my vibe!
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink, i got my music
i would share it, but today i'm yelling
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!


look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
i can feel the changes
i can feel a new life, i always knew life can be dangerous
i can say that i like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
you don't know what pain is
how can i paint this picture
when the color blind is hangin' with you?
fell on my face and awoke with a scar
another mistake livin' deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
i can admit that it did look like yours
why you resent every making of this?
tell me your purpose is petty again
but even a small lighter can burn a bridge
even a small lighter can burn a bridge


i can feel the changes
i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
you can see that my city found me
then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
to you that's a quick check
with all disrespect, let me say this


i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord, forgive me! lord, forgive me!
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!

i would share it, but today i'm yelling
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!


i'm tryin' to keep it alive
and not compromise the feeling we love
you're tryin' to keep it deprived
and only co-sign what radio does
and i'm lookin' right past you
we live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
you live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
i know what you scared of
the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
this shit is vital, i know you had to
this shit is vital, i know you had to
die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
rather a seasonal name
i'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
i'ma break out and then hide every lock
i'ma break out and then hide every lock


i can feel the changes
i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
you can see that my city found me
then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
to you that's a quick check
with all disrespect, let me say this


i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord, forgive me! lord, forgive me!
things i don't understand

i got my drink, i got my music
i would share it, but today i'm yelling
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!


bitch, don't kill my vibe!
you ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
don't you see that long line?
and they waiting on kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
threes in the air, i can see you are in sync
hide your feelings, hide your feelings
now what you better do
i'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!
walk out the door and they scream it's alive
my new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
talk too motherfuckin' much, i got my drink, i got my music
i say bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!
bitch, don't kill my vibe! bitch, don't kill my vibe!

for a nigga labeled as bein' a mothafuckin' villain
but you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
how so many prayed i'd be a mothafuckin' failure
real niggas gotta have top rankin'
i hooked up with three more niggas and started makin'
funky-ass shit for your system

sample of a ruthless organization
but you don't want a confrontation
real niggas don't play

false niggas, end up as tossed niggas
and that's on the real, cause i'm a nigga that kills

where the crime was too tragic i couldn't make bail
so now they gotta hold me
and listen to rehabilitation over and over, sayin' they told me

Microphone Fiend|Eric B. & Rakim|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i was a fiend before i became a teen
i melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
music-orientated so when hip-hop was originated
fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
'cause i grabbed the mic and try to say, ""yes, y'all""
they tried to take it, and say that i'm too small
cool, 'cause i don't get upset
i kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then i jet
back to the lab, without a mic to grab
so then i add all the rhymes i had
one after the other one, then i make another one
to diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine
but i don't need a cigarette, know what i mean?
i'm raging, ripping up the stage and
don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
thought of, 'cause it's sort of an addiction
magnetized by the mixing
vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
the mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting
rhymes overflowing, gradually growing
everything is written in a code, so it can coincide
my thought's a guide
48 tracks to slide
the invincible microphone fiend rakim
spread the word, 'cause i'm in e-f-f-e-c-t
a smooth operator operating correctly
but back to the problem, i got a habit
you can't solve it, silly rabbit
the prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
i fiend for a microphone like heroin
soon as the bass kicks, i need a fix
gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
and i'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness? beware, it's the re-animator
a menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
an assassinator, if the people ain't stepping
you see a part of me that you never seen
when i'm fiending for a microphone, i'm the microphone fiend
after 12, i'm worse than a gremlin
feed me hip-hop and i start trembling
the thrill of suspense is intense, you're horrified
but this ain't the cinemas or tales from the darkside
by any means necessary, this is what has to be done
make way 'cause here i come
my dj cuts material
grand imperial
it's a must that i bust any mic you hand to me
it's inherited, it runs in the family
i wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back
if that don't slow 'em up, i carry a full pack
now i don't want to have to let off, you should have kept off
you didn't keep the stage warm, step off
ladies and gentleman, you're about to see
a pastime, hobby about to be
taken to the maximum, i can't relax see
i'm hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
hell of an antidote, something you can't smoke, more than dope
you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
more than cracked up, you should have backed up
for those that act up need to be more than smacked up
any entertainer, i got a torture chamber
one on one and i'm the remainder
so close your eyes and hold your breath
and i'mma hit ya with the blow of death
before you go, you'll remember ya seen
the fiend of a microphone, i'm the microphone fiend
the microphone fiend"

Children's Story|Slick Rick|hip-hop-rap-trap|"

(now here's a little something that needs to be heard)


uncle ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
please, huh, please?
all right, you kids get to bed, i'll get the storybook
y'all tucked in? yeah
here we go


once upon a time not long ago
when people wore pajamas and lived life slow
when laws were stern and justice stood
and people were behavin' like they ought ta: good
there lived a little boy who was misled
by another little boy and this is what he said:
""me and you, ty, we're gonna make some cash
robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""
they did the job, money came with ease
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
he robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
tried to rob a man who was a d.t. undercover
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
he said ""keep still, boy, no need for static""
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
but little did he know the little boy was strapped
the kid pulled out a gun, he said ""why'd you hit me?""
the barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
the cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""i'll do years if i pull this trigga""
so he cold dashed and ran around the block
cop radios in to another lady cop
he ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
looked 'round good and from expectations
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations
but she was coming and he made a left
he was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath
knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
then he made his move to an abandoned building
ran up the stairs up to the top floor
opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?)
dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
he said ""i need bullets, hurry up, run!""
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
he went outside but there was cops all over
then he dipped into a car ‒ a stolen nova
raced up the block doing 83
crashed into a tree near university
escaped alive though the car was battered
rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
ran out of bullets and he still had static
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
he told the cops ""back off or honey here's dead""
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
so he let the lady go and he starts to run on
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
and before long the little boy got surrounded
he dropped his gun, so went the glory
and this is the way i have to end this story
he was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
the cops shot the kid, i still hear him scream
this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
just another case about the wrong path
straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast
good night


(knock him out the box, rick
knock him out, rick)
- oh boy, that uncle ricky is really weird
- i know right what does he mean
“straight and narrow or yo’ soul gets cast""?
- i don’t know, i think he be crackin' it up or something
- well, good night
- good night

ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
you ready? uh, uh


i used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
so i had to grind like that to shine like this
and the amount of time i spent on some locked-up shit
in the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
it was time to marry the game and i said, ""yeah, i do""
if you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
got a shorty, she tryna bless me like i said achoo
like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
i'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
of what we started, lil' nigga but i'm lion-hearted
they love me when i was stuck and they hated when i departed
i go and get it regardless, draw it like i'm a artist
no crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
all foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, i got 'em
i did it without a album
i did shit with mariah

phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
you ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?

i'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'cause these niggas want me dead and i gotta make it back home
'cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
these niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
you fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'cause these philly niggas i brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
all i know is murder, when it come to me
i got young niggas that's rollin', i got niggas throwin' b's

Only God Can Judge Me|2Pac|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
only god can judge me (that right?)
only god can judge me now
nobody else (nobody else)
all you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
only god can judge me now


perhaps i was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
i couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
will i succeed? paranoid from the weed
and hocus pocus, i try to focus, but i can't see
and in my mind i'm a blind man doin' time
look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
i've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause i'm cursed
and fantasies of my family in a hearse
and they say it's the white man i should fear
but it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
i can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
jealousy inside, make 'em wish i died
oh my lord, tell me what i'm livin' for
everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on heaven's door
and all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
and everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘cause the media is full of dirty tricks


only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me now
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me




i hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' i can make it
got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
still i can't breathe, something's evil in my iv
‘cause everytime i breathe i think they killin' me
i'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
i wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
i call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
how did it come to this? i wish they didn't miss
somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘cause even thugs cry, but do the lord care?
try to remember but it hurts
i'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
i'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
there's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours
""black power!"" is what we scream
as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate is a lifetime of hate
dear mama, can you save me? and fuck peace
‘cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
no more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
and they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
mr. police, please try to see
that there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me


only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me now
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me


that which does not kill me can only make me stronger
that's for real
and i don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
you know?
let me live, baby, let me live


pac, i feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
for instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
he gon' get me first, if i don't get him fool start prayin'
ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
so judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
that's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
after talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
tellin' them niggas, ""you can fade him""
punk, i wish you would
it be them same motherfuckers in your face
that'll rush up in your place to get your safe
knowin' you on that paper chase
grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
my new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
bitch, remember 2pac and 4-tay
the same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the bay
pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""i'll be around""
start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
that's why they ride the bandwagon
still be draggin', sellin' lies
don't think i don't see you haters, i know y'all in disguise


guess you figure you know me, ‘cause i'm a thug
that love to hit the late night clubs drink them buds
been livin' lavish like a player all day
now i'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-tay


only god can judge me

All the Above (feat. T-Pain)|Maino|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
on a mission to be, what i'm destined to be
i've done been through the pain and the sorrow
the struggle it's nothing but love
i'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
all the above (x7)


listen! really what do you see, when you looking at me?
see me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
i've done been through the bottom, i've done suffered a lot
i deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
look how i ride for the block, look how i rep for the hood
i got nothing but love, now that i come through the hood
getting this fortune and fame, money ain't goin' to shame?
the new benz is all white, call it john mccain
how the hell could you stop me? why in the world would you try?
i go hard forever, that's just how i'm designed
that's just how i was built, see the look in my eyes
you take all of this from me, and i'm still gon' survive
you get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
i'm a part of these streets, till the day that i die
i wave hi to the haters, mad that i finally done made it
take a look, and you can tell that i'm destined for greatness




it's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
put your foot in my nike's, picture you living my life
picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
i perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
you've been seeing me lately, i'm a miracle baby
i refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
i put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
when i think that i can't, i envision obama
i envision in diamonds, i envision ferrari's
if the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
ain't you happy i made it? man i'm making a statement
take a look, and you can tell that i'm destined for greatness





now if i'm out on the spot
or if i'm out on the block
i hustle hard cause it's all the same (they know, they know)
if you know that grind don't stop
because i rose to the top
and everybody knows my name (maino, maino)
hey! i'm still grinding, still hustling
no more pain, no more suffering
my ladies and my shorties and my thugs
keep on dancing and shining for love

feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
every step that i take is another mistake to you
(caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
and every second i waste is more than i can take!


i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
i've become so numb

""okay, then we are crack babies.""
""damn, why you say that?"" she said, ""where my drink at?""
""i'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax.""
i stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; jumbotron
made to the back where she reside

yep, hope that i get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up
when the nuvo start to drown her body and i know

it's nothin' we can do now
somebody walked in with a pound of that bay area kush
she looked at me, then looked at it

so many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
this life as a rap star is nothin' without guard

to be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
to catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear, ""go to the telly, ho!""
equipped with money in a benz 'cause, bitch, i'm barely broke
i'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
from player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
from hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
i got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
i'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so i'm wishin'

pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause i know they comin' for me
i been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
now i'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
question my methods to switch up speeds
sure as some bitches bleed
niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers

so now i'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
they cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up

lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
for money i'll have these motherfuckers buried

knowin' when i get out they gon' feel it

you made my heart break
you made my heart ache (i still see your shadows in my room)

you made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)

i still see your shadows in my room
can't take back the love that i gave you
it's to the point where i love and i hate you
and i cannot change you, so i must replace you, oh
easier said than done, i thought you were the one
listenin' to my heart instead of my head
you found another one, but i am the better one
i won't let you forget me

Paul Revere|Beastie Boys|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


now here's a little story i've got to tell
about three bad brothers you know so well
it started way back in history
with ad-rock, mca, (and me) mike d
been had a little horsey named paul revere
just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
riding across the land, kicking up sand
sheriff's posse on my tail 'cause i'm in demand
one lonely beastie i be
all by myself without nobody
the sun is beating down on my baseball hat
the air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
looking for a girl, i ran into a guy
his name was mca, i said howdy, he said hi


he told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
the brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
his voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
he said, ""can i get some?"" – i said, ""you can't get none!""
had a chance to run but he pulled out his shotgun
quick on the draw, i thought i'd be dead
he put the gun to my head, and this is what he said
now my name is mca, i've got a license to kill
i think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill
now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer?
i run this land, you understand? i made myself clear?
we stepped into the wind, he had a gun, i had a grin
you think this story's over, but it's ready to begin


now i got the gun, you got the brew
you got two choices of what you can do
it's not a tough decision as you can see
i can blow you away or you can ride with me
i said, i'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
the sheriff's after me for what i did to his daughter
i did it like this, i did it like that
i did it with a wiffleball bat
so i'm on the run, the cop's got my gun
and right about now it's time to have some fun
the king ad-rock, that is my name
and i know the fly spot where they got the champagne
we rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
the beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
this dude was staring like he knows who we are
we took the empty spot next to him at the bar
mca said, ""ayo, you know this kid?""
i said i didn't, but i knew he did
the kid said, (""get ready 'cause this ain't funny
my name's mike d and i'm about to get money"")
pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky
he yelled (""stick 'em up!"") and let two fly
hands went up and people hit the floor
he wasted two kids that ran for the door
(""i'm mike d and i get respect
your cash and your jewelry is what i expect"")
mca was with it and he's my ace
so i grabbed the piano player and i punched him in the face
the piano player's out, the music stopped
this boy had beef and he got dropped
(mike d grabbed the money) mca snatched the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold"

Changes|2Pac|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i see no changes, wake up in the morning and i ask myself
is life worth livin'? should i blast myself?
i'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, i'm black
my stomach hurts so i'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
one less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
first ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""it's time to fight back,"" that's what huey said
two shots in the dark, now huey's dead
i got love for my brother
but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
we gotta start makin' changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
how can the devil take a brother if he's close to me?
i'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things change… and that's the way it is


that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is, aww yeah
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is, aww yeah


i see no changes, all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under, i wonder what it takes to make this
one better place, let's erase the wasted
take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
and the only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
and although it seems heaven-sent
we ain't ready to see a black president
it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
but some things will never change
try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
now tell me, what's a mother to do?
bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
you gotta operate the easy way
""i made a g today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
sellin' crack to the kids
""i gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is


that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is, aww yeah
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is, aww yeah


we gotta make a change
it's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
let's change the way we eat
let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other
you see the old way wasn't workin'
so it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive


and still i see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
it's war on the streets and a war in the middle east
instead of war on poverty
they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
and i ain't never did a crime i ain't have to do
but now i'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
crack you up and pimp-smack you up
you gotta learn to hold your own
they get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
but tell the cops they can't touch this
i don't trust this, when they try to rush i bust this
that's the sound of my tool
you say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
and as long as i stay black, i gotta stay strapped
and i never get to lay back
‘cause i always got to worry 'bout the payback
some buck that i roughed up way back
comin' back after all these years
""rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is


that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is, aww yeah
(you're my brother, you're my sister)
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is, aww yeah


some things'll never change"

Hits from the Bong|Cypress Hill|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
hits from the bong
hits from the bong
hits from the bong
hits from the bong


pick it, pack it, fire it up, come along
and take a hit from the bong
put the blunt down just for a second
don’t get me wrong it’s not a new method
inhale, exhale
just got a ounce in the mail
i like a blunt or a big fat cone
but my double barrel bong is gettin’ me stoned
home skillet, there’s water inside don’t spill it
it smells like shit on the carpet, still it
goes down smooth when i get a clean hit
of the skunky funky smelly green shit
sing my song, puff all night long
as i take hits from the bong


hits from the bong y’all
can i get a hit?
hits from the bong
can i get a hit?
hits from the bong
can i get a hit?
hits from the bong


let’s smoke that bowl, hit the bong
and then take that finger off of that hole
plug it, unplug it, don’t strain
i love you mary jane
she never complains, when i hit mary
with that flame, i light up the cherry
she’s so good to me
when i pack a fresh bowl i clean the screen
don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling
water is makin’ it pure so i got ta’
take my hit and hold it, just like
chong, i hit the bowl and i reload it
get my four-footer and bring it on
as i take hits from the bong


hits from the bong
can i get a hit?
hits from the bong
can i get a hit?
hits from the bong
can i get a hit?
hits from the bong
can i get a hit?
hits from the bong
can i get a hit?


this shit’ll straighten your dick out
can i get a hit?"

we was already molded into people's minds as mulignanes
now we more fucks'd up with a mayor named giuliani
you can try to blind me, analyze but can't define me
my mind's divine, heavily entwined with gandhi's
far from feeble, i leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
'cause my cerebrals are more of a higher plane than the hebrews
my mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
overdosin' wannabes posin', sendin' them through convulsions
too hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
your mind's boggled
but i'm as deep as donald goines novels
my whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
and since a minor, i been fuckin' with marijuana
wavy-hair, my skin got a money gettin' glare
strictly menace wear, mackin' off a guinness beer
so, where it all begins is here
destiny and me finally meet
so, how can i be weak? i'm rather unique

so check it out why, why, why i'm rather unique
az check him out, one time why, why, why i'm rather unique


my verbals rip shit, brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
fuck it, i'm on some flip shit, ready to let my clip spit
dramatical, vocals release shells like automatics do
music's magical, causin' any battles to be tragical, child
got a style sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
slaughter your circulatory like leukemia
filled with larceny, who want parts of me? i'm vicious
mad malicious 'cause it's real on this road to riches
i got this mastered, other rappers'll graft it, weak and wicked
camouflagin' as killers; how they speak and kick it
peep this uniqueness, non-believers i'm leavin' speechless
left to choke as if skunk smoke was comin' through the speakers
surgically nice with any verbal device
trife, breathin' life into mics
my eyesight's beyond the twilight
so, die or fight, no surrender, no retreat
techniques speak, i'm rather unique


so check it out why i'm rather unique
uhh why, why, i'm rather unique
east new york, east new york why, why, i'm rather unique

my man az to the fullest


so, it's gonna take more than your astrologist to knowledge this
physiologists couldn't even figure out the exoticness
raps demolishin', certified the way i style it
my wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolet
my culture's smilin', gettin' more in depth with each breath
autobiography follows the footsteps of malcolm x
money and sex, gore-tex, donna karan and guess
finesse, success through the life stress, mics i bless
puffin' trees to get me high as trapeze
lookin' japanese, at ease when i'm stackin' g's
so, let's discuss, plus degrees
why the rhyme force is the source for thoughts that's lost
so, don't cross 'cause it'll cost
the ghetto savior, smooth for real, playa with flavor
moves be major, with un-explainable behavior
the word's on the street so keep your ears to the concrete
why i'm rather unique


why i'm rather unique

starin' at candles
oh, that shit is on?
let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth


at night i can't sleep, i toss and turn
candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
four walls just starin' at a nigga
i'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
my mother's always stressin' i ain't livin' right
but i ain't goin' out without a fight
see, every time my eyes close
i start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
it's somebody watchin' the ak'
but i don't know who it is, so i'm watchin' my back
i can see him when i'm deep in the covers
when i awake i don't see the motherfucker
he owns a black hat like i own
a black suit and a cane like my own
some might say, ""take a chill, b.""
but fuck that shit! there's a nigga tryin' to kill me
i'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
investigatin' the joint for traps
checkin' my telephone for taps
i'm starin' at the woman on the corner
it's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya


i make big money, i drive big cars
everybody know me; it's like i'm a movie star
but late at night, somethin' ain't right
i feel i'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
is it that fool that i ran off the block?
or is it that nigga last week that i shot?
or is it the one i beat for 5000 dollars?
thought he had 'caine, but it was gold medal flour
reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
ain't no use to me lyin'
i was scareder than a motherfucker
hooked a left into popeye's and bailed out quick
if it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
here they come just like i figured
i got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
what i saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
i live by the sword
i take my boys everywhere i go, because i'm paranoid
i keep lookin' over my shoulder
and peepin' around corners; my mind is playin' tricks on me


day by day it's more impossible to cope
i feel like i'm the one that's doin' dope
can't keep a steady hand, because i'm nervous
every sunday morning i'm in service
prayin' for forgiveness
and tryin' to find an exit out the business
i know the lord is lookin' at me
but yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
i often drift when i drive
havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
bang and get it over with
and then i'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
i got a little boy to look after
and if i die, then my child'll be a bastard
i had a woman down with me
but to me it seemed like she was down to get me
she helped me out in this shit
but to me she was just another bitch
now she's back with her mother
now i'm realizing that i love her
now i'm feelin' lonely
my mind is playin' tricks on me


this year halloween fell on a weekend
me and geto boys are trick-or-treatin'
robbin' little kids for bags
'til a law man got behind our ass
so we speeded up the pace
took a look back and he was right before our face
he'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
so i swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
he was goin' down we figured
but this wasn't no ordinary nigga
he stood about six or seven feet
now that's the nigga i be seein' in my sleep
so we triple-teamed on him
droppin' them motherfuckin' b's on him
the more i swung, the more blood flew
then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
then i felt just like a fiend
it wasn't even close to halloween
it was dark as fuck on the streets
my hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
goddamn, homie!
my mind is playin' tricks on me"
Dollaz + Sense|DJ Quik|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
now let's get down to business, bitches!
'cause it seems like y'all just keep on tryin' to diss this
nigga that you know that's been down for years
i've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
nine, ten—eiht, you can't win
'cause all the way around, nigga, i gets respect
and you's a nigga that can't even get no props in yo' set
tragniew park you say, huh?
wanna be rippin', but now it's time to do some set trippin'
so listen close, 'cause i don't want y'all to miss
that i'm 'bout to break it down for this bitch, check it
acacia, poplar, maple, spruce, cedar, elm
westside trees sprayin' all the fleas
that's from the three and four hundred block p-funk riders
(so niggas watch yo' ass at that center divider *gun blast*)
now aaron tyler, tell my why you seem so tame
when i caught you at the airport, shakin' like a crap game
you looked up and you seen my niggas comin'
and you looked like yo' bitch-ass was 'bout to start runnin'
but all i wanted to do was kick a little conversation
(yo, whatup?) and see if we can fix this little situation
but would i fuck you up was what you wondered
yeah, that's probably why you
changed your little pager number (punk-ass!)
but bitches like you don't grow
you can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe
and callin' me skinny, you's a clown
i'ma call you theo 'cause you weigh 92.3 pounds
wack-ass actor, movie script killer
fool, don't you know? quik is still the nigga
compton psycho, boy, you oughta quit
your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit
you need to stay down, you compton clown
and get off of the nuts of the niggas with guts
because i'm down with the trees, i'm down with death row
i'm down with black tone, and i'm down with the fo'
so when we cross paths and i hope that's soon
i'ma boot yo' mothafuckin' ass to the moon
you need to quit bangin' under false pretense
'cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense


if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense

now i'ma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand
take a deep breath and cook it like a chef and
this is dedicated to the c-p-t
no, better yet t-t-p, or the niggas that look up to me
i make it my business to be that true forever
and whenever i can come clever, well, that's my endeavor
so whether or not you understand
that there's only one dj q-u-i-k
with no c still you can't be me
because i'm floatin' in my lex and
depositin fat checks and
gettin' mad sex while i floss the nsx and
doin' what i wanna, and you's a goner, nigga
for thinkin' that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner
remember compton's in the house, and quik is in the hood
sippin' 'nac with all my niggas 'cause it's to the good
so don't knock it 'til you try it
'cause eiht, he tried to knock it
but he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket
so put the p in it, represent and sip that miller
and for those of y'all concerned, this is still eiht killa
let me take a load off my scrotum, little pest
if it don't make dollars, nigga, you know the rest


if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
so don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
so don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
so don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense

now i done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that i kick
while you groupie-ass niggas keep on ridin' the dick
you oughta know that dj quik
ain't your average everyday motherfucker (hah)
slick like a snake 'cause i stuck ya
now, i never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
but you gon' be the first, you little trick-ass ho
then you can tell me just how it taste
but before i nut i shoot some piss in your face
you fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck
'cause when i caught yo' ass, you put yourself in check
and when you left my presence you left speedin'
you ain't no fuckin' killer, you's a comedian, beyotch!
tell me why you act so scary
givin' your set a bad name with your misspelled name
e-i-h-t, now should i continue?
yeah, you left out the g 'cause the g ain't in you
remember that time you was rollin' on the westside
and a little brown bucket pulled up on your side
caught at that light in your camry in the midst of a real killer
tell me, did you feel a little nervous? (hell yeah)
you was in the shadow of death
with two trey-five-sevens pointed at your chest
hmm, whatchu gon' do? where was your niggas that kill at
you ain't got no killers, so kill dat!
holdin' up your hands and beggin for a pass
you lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass
'cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
so you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, beyotch!


if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
so don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
i'm through playing wit'cho punk ass

shouts goes out to my well-known road dog
what's up donzelle tru?
they don't understand it, baby, they can't fade us out here on these compton streets (beyotch!)
it's bigger than they can imagine
to the whole entire death row family
both sides, whassup, niggas?
and my nigga big suge, known for keepin' shit poppin'
to my nigga big j, my little nigga hi-c, little straight g
and that little singin'-ass nigga danny boy
y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this
i'm the first nigga that was ""bangin on wax""

silence keeps cloudin' me
hand on my heart
and i, i wish time never mattered


yeah, stylin’ though
dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
all the things you need, you still want problems though
all the things i know, i still been silent though
yeah, used to be at silvercity, indigo
used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
i don't want to have to go to funerals
i gotta start sleepin' at the studio
i don't have no time to be no romeo
all the love i need is at the rodeo
all the love i need is here at ovo, yeah
all the girls i know are there with e and tho
who knows where i end up when that shit gets old?
maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
last table left in carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
i take a glass of domina to go with me home
might move our annual shit to the 'dome
i need 40,000 people to see what i'm on
yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
i was an angry yute when i was writin’ views
saw a side of myself that i just never knew
i’ll probably self-destruct if i ever lose, but i never do
steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and i open up like a double click
more blessings because i'm generous
thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
i can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
but you can rest assure that my mind is right
get no sick days, i leave for like three months in six days
never stick around to see shit change
get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
seasons go by like i'm binge-watchin'
went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv
to not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
i can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
especially people that want to lecture me
and frame it like they just want the best for me
or they check for me, whatever splits it up
so there's more for them and there's less for me
they don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
no one's done it successfully
7am in germany, can't believe that they heard of me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
that's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
if we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
you overnight celebrity, you one day star
swear i told you that i'm in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
behind closed doors, a lot of 6 god worshipping
done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
there's real ones around me
i want to make sure they learn from me
i want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
he can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
my life is centered 'round competition and currency
takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me i need recovery
maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
i'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
more life"

100 Miles And Runnin'|N.W.A.|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
catch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them
hey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up
you don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
we haven't spotted them yet. but they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity


a 100 miles and runnin' -  mc ren, i hold the gun and
you want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
since i'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
is one of the main reasons i don't give a fuck
chances are usually not good
'cause i'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood
and gettin' jacked by the you-know-who
when in a black and white the capacity is two
we're not alone, we're three more brothers, i mean street-brothers
not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers
they're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
point blank, they can kiss my black ass
i didn't stutter when i said ""fuck tha police""
'cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
now it's broken and can't be fixed
'cause police and little black niggas don't mix so
now i'm creepin' through the fall
runnin' like a g, we'll see, i might have slayed y'all
so for now pack the gun and
hold it in the air 'cause mc ren has a 100 miles of runnin'


in today's news. four fugitives are on the run
fbi sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their home base, compton


lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
so i can tell you why


runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
with a steady pace on the face that just reads race
the road ahead goes on and on
the shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
runnin' on but never runnin' out
stayin' wired and if i get tired, i can still try out
hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
but nobody's pickin' up a nigga witta attitude
confused, yo but dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose
one of the few who's been accused and abused
of the crime of poisonin' young minds
but you don't know shit til you been in my shoes
and dre is back from the c-p-t
droppin' some shit that's d-o-p-e
so fuck the p-o-l-i-c-e!
and any mutherfucker that disagrees
stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
'cause i been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
my mind was slick - my temper was too quick
now the fbi's all over my dick


got the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
that's when the e jumped off the startin' block
a 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch
a little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
yeah, back to compton again
yo, it's either that or the federal pen
'cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind
runnin' like i just don't care
compton's 50 miles but, yo, i'mma get there
archin' my back and on a straight route
just like carl lewis i'm ballin' the fuck out
from city to city i'm a menace as i pass by
rippin' up shit just so you can remember i'm
a straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
straight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'


this one goes out to the four brothers from compton
you're almost there, but the fbi has a little message for you:
nowhere to run to, baby. nowhere to hide
good luck brothers


runnin' like a nigga i hate to lose
show me on the news but i hate to be abused
i know it was a set-up - so now i'm gonna get up
even if the fbi wants me to shut up
but i've got 10 000 niggas strong
they got everybody singin' my ""fuck tha police"" song
and while they treat my group like dirt
their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our t-shirts
so i'mma run 'til i can't run no more
'cause it's time for mc ren to settle the score
i got a urge to kick down doors
at my grave like a slave even if the ren calls


clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
so now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
the number's even - now i'm leavin'
we're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
her and the troops are right behind me
but they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me


one more mile to go through the dark streets
runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
but you know i never stumble or lag last
i'm almost home so i better haul ass
tearin' up everything in sight
it's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
now that chase, the shit, is done and
four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
a 100 miles of runnin'!

that organic flow you probably see up in whole foods
shiver me timbers, something's fishy 'bout you, mr. d ritter
when i told you that i wanted new management
why the fuck you throw a fit and seem bitter?
why you catch an attitude whenever i question you
about all my fuckin' percentages?
i know why (why?), you've been bendin' it
in your benefit—your honor, i'm innocent!

see, he has a gamblin' issue
he takes the cash and blows it all at casinos (damn!)

you start avoidin' me, that's some disloyalty
you woke up the evil boy in me, your ass is poisoning
tell me why you would destroy fv?
this was a fuckin' vision that i had created with your brother
but you too infatuated with the money
you killed it and ran it straight into the gutter
now i think, ""why'd i make d—a—m—e the boss?""
you keep pissin' a whole lot of people off

you on that same bullshit tomica brought

thought it was music above all the business

you tarnished the brand
and you started a funk volume fitness?
come on now, really think
got us portrayin' somethin' we really ain’t
how we supposed to be ill
when you on our website with a shake weight
tryna be billy blanks—nigga, thanks!
fool, ain’t nobody tryna lift weights

but you don’t understand the culture of hip-hop
you a lame-ass nigga, dame, half the crew knows

i hate your fuckin' name, every letter
i’m very fed up, you actin' like an ordinary heffa
i’ma take you to the mortuary dress-up
we gave you our trust, then you had us cornered
you got us a shitty label deal with warner
and if i confront you about it
you tell me i need counsellin' and i got a disorder
you sent me on tour and it’s horror
shitty hotels, no sleep, with no food to order
meet and greets every single day, it’s torture
how you expectin' an a1 performer?
every time something’s wrong it’s the same thing (what?)

what are your fuckin' motives, dame? let’s talk about it!
umm, you’re our manager, our label-owner, our accountant
hmm, that’s kinda tricky
something is fishy, that’s risky
we just don’t even know
we go with the flow while you rowin’ the boat
you keepin' us simple-minded
'cause you knowin’ our only concern is just hopin’ we blow
so, when all the money come in from our album and tours
you sit there and soak in the dough
when did we ever ask about the gross?
when did we ever ask about the net?
you would just hand us money from our shows
'cause you knew we wasn’t questionin' the checks
nigga, i trusted you with my life
you upped your percentage so i’m makin' less?!
fuck you, bitch, you get no respect!
this is why hop is comin' for your neck (bless!)

so, good luck, jarren, dizzy, hoppa, swizzz, i’m goin' solo

everybody knows you be on it

change is one of the most difficult things that we face. but change is inevitable. one reason we don’t like change is we get comfortable where we are. we get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. and even if it’s not perfect we accept it, because it’s familiar. and what happens is, because we’re not willing to change, we get stuck in what god used to do, instead of moving forward into what god is about to do. just because god’s blessed you where you are doesn’t mean you can just sit back and settle there. you have to stay open to what god is doing now. what worked five years ago may not work today. if you’re going to be successful, you have to be willing to change. every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. we should constantly evaluate our friendships. who’s speaking into your life? who are you depending on? make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever. if you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends"

up out of there
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
eh, light that up, snoop! why you actin' like that?
ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
you done put two of america's most wanted
in the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
have one on us, a'ight?
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
a toast to the gangsters


picture perfect, i paint a perfect picture
bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
with the s-n double-o-p, dogg, my fuckin' homie
you's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs


sure 'nough, i keep my hand on my gun
'cause they got me on the run
now i'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""free 2pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
but at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
so i'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
and put together a million march for some gangsta shit


so now they got us laced
two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
me and snoop about to clown
i'm losin' my religion, i'm vicious on these stool pigeons
you might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
i've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish


i've got a pit named petey, she nigerina
i've got a house out in the hills right next to chino
and i think i've got a black bimmer
but my dream is to own a fly casino
like bugsy siegel, and do it all legal
and get scooped up by the little homie in the regal
it feels good to you, baby-bubba
you see, this is for the g's and the keys, motherfucker


now follow as we ride
motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the westside
and i can make you famous
niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
i live in fear of a felony
i never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' g's
if you got it, better flaunt it
another warrant, two of america's most wanted

ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(nothin' but a gangsta party
it ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party


now give me fifty feet
defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
and keep whatever's left of me
jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
i bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
there ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
you thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
bow down in the presence of a boss player


it's like cuzz, blood, gang-bangin'
everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
you gotta have papers in this world
you might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
you doin' your job every day
and then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
you see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids


they tell me not to roll with my glock
so now i got a throw-away
floatin' in the black benz (bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
they wonder how i live with five shots
niggas is hard to kill on my block
schemes for currency and dough-related
affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
no answers to questions, i'm tryin' to get up on it
my nigga dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted


ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(nothin' but a gangsta party
it ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)

The Ringer|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
*plane crash*
yeah (illa)
yo, i'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause i feel like i wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
yeah


let me explain just how to make greatness
straight out the gate, i'm ’bout to break it down
ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, i'm 'bout
to rape the alphabet, i may raise some brows
if i press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr!)
full magazine could take staples out
savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
but bitch, i'm off the chain like kala brown
motherfucker, shut the fuck up when i’m talkin’, lil' bitch
i’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? oh, critiquin'
my talent? oh, bitch, i don't know who the fuck y’all are
to give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
you mention me, millions of views, attention in news
i mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
billions of views, your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
don't get misconstrued, business as us'
shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
or get dissed 'cause i just don't get
what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though? prob'ly no
get this fuckin' audio out my audi, yo, adiós
i can see why people like lil yachty, but not me though
not even dissin', it just ain't for me
all i am simply is just an emcee
maybe ""stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (get it?)
maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit, preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
i should eat a pill, probably i will
old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror, i don't see my breath
possibly i'm dead, i must be possessed
like an evil spell, i'm e-v-i-l (evil, spelled)
jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick
with an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vice president mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ, man, how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (fuck my side chick!)
you won't ever see em icy
but as cold as i get on the m-i-c
i polarize shit, so the thames might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch, i got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
turn down for what?
i ain't loud enough, nah, turn the valium up!
'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut
now when it doesn't matter what caliber
i spit at, i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
you'll turn around and just be like, ""man, how the fuck
sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
and now he wants to take it out on us."" (ooouuu)
but last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
it'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (oooouuu)
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
i'd just be like everyone else in the fuckin' industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me (nfing)
so finger-bang, chicken wang, mgk, igg' azae'
lil pump, lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
i'm fed up with bein' humble
and rumor is i'm hungry, i'm sure you heard rumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
the era that i'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two
and dump on you, if you ain't joyner
if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean, then you're a goner
i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's
but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
and you woulda bought it
but sayin' i no longer got it
'cause you missed a line and never caught it
'cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what i'll never be is flawless, all i'll ever be is honest
even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom
if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i don't see why y'all even started with me
i get in beefs, my enemies die
i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
i'm east side, never be caught slippin'
now you see why i don't sleep, not even a wink, i don't blink
i don't doze off, i don't even nod to the beats
i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze
""aw, man! that bet cypher was weak, it was garbage
the thing ain't even orange—oh my god, that's a reach!""
shout to all my colorblind people
each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""dawg, that's a date.""  ""looks like an olive to me.""
""look, there's an apple!"" no, it's not, it's a peach!
so finger-bang, pootie tang
burger king, gucci gang, dookie, dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for 2018 to get underway
but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
invite 'em in like a one a day
i'm not done (preach!)
'cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'cause the way i see people turning's
makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined?
'cause i'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
but if i could go back, i'd at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that he's deserted
but i think it's workin'
these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
and he's too scurred to answer me with words
'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least he's heard it
'cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him
or ask if i'm linked to terrorists
i said, ""only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
but my beef is more media journalists
(hold up, hold up, hold up…)
i said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and yes, i mean eatin' a penis
'cause they been pannin' my album to death
so i been givin' the media fingers
don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but they been puttin' me through the ringer
so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press
but i just took this beat to the cleaners"

finesse fell off—that’s what some figure.  you better
see mary blige and get the 411, nigga
i rock rappers frequently.  i’m like
stevie wonder—i can’t see a brother beating me
wanna throw joints?  you’ll get spanked, fella.  wanna talk
dough?  i’m seeing more cash than a bank teller
wanna talk girls?  you can’t follow this—i’ve been
through more skins than the average dermatologist
i’m no joke on a fast or slow tip
pockets stay so thick, be on some down-low shit
i turn emcees red fast
i’ll never sell out—fuck that, yo, i’m deadass
i’m rolling like tnt.  when it
comes to this, ain’t another brother seeing me
that’s why opponents always get scared, ‘cause i’ll
make brothers go, “ayyo, now that’s that shit there!”

i’m hip to

check it
brothers better lounge when i pass through town

word life, i’m not a new figure.  they say
“good things come to those who wait”—i’m overdue, nigga
i’ll lounge and rock tunes.  the way i be
saving the day, give me a cape and a costume
but, no, it’s not batman.  it’s the original
blackman that goes back like the gap band
i don’t run scams, got dumb fans.  yo, i’m one
man that’s quick to toast a nigga like a sun tan
people wondered: would i rock again?  shit
rap without finesse is like life without oxygen
it’s no quiz i get biz.  you know what the

can’t a rapper out play me

i get stupid but i’m dumb wise.  i’m one
guy that can rock a party from night until sunrise
you can’t mess with the rap lord—that’s like
saying you can dunk when you can’t touch the backboard
hah, i got the smooth rep.  i got
styles that kung fu motherfuckers didn’t use yet
how long i been rocking raps?

he stopped, he took a deep breath, he said
woooooo, good morning, ladies hahahaha

everybody just crowd around the mic, i'll tell you all these mutha-fuckin' jokes

colt 45 and two zig zags, baby that's all we need
we can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
and as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
stop and hit the bong like cheech and chong, sell tapes from here to hong kong
so roll, roll, roll my joint. pick out the seeds and stems
feelin' high as hell flyin' through palmdale, skatin' on dayton rims
so roll, roll the '83 cadillac coup de ville
if my tapes and my cd's just don't sell, i bet my caddy will

well it was just sundown in a small white town. they call it eastside palmdale
when the afroman walked through the white land, houses went up for sale
well, i was standin' on the corner sellin' rap cd's when i met a little girl named jan
i let her ride in my caddy cause i didn't know her daddy was the leader of the klu klux klan
we fucked on the bed, fucked on the flo', fucked so long, i grew a fuckin' afro
then i fucked to the left, fucked to the right. she sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
i thought to myself, sheba, sheba! got my ass lookin' like a zebra!
i pulled on my clothes and i was on my way, until her daddy pulled up in a chevrolet
i ran. i jumped out the back window, but her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4
oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. the mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night
but i ain't mad at her prejudiced dad, that's the best damn pussy i ever had
i got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. i'm a fuck that bitch just one more time

i met this lady in hollywood. she had green hair, but damn she looked good
i took her to my house, cause she was fine, but she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine
i met this lady from japan, never made love with an african
i fucked her once, i fucked her twice. i ate that pussy like shrimp fried rice
don't be amazed at the stories i tell ya. i met a woman in the heart of australia
had a big butt and big titties, too, so i hopped in her ass like a kangaroo
see, i met this woman from hawaii. stuck it in her ass, and she said, aiiiiieeee!
lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch, then her titties busted open with hawaiian punch
met colonel sander's wife in the state of kentucky. she said, i'll fry some chicken if you just fuck me
i came in her mouth. it was a crisis. i gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices

fucked this girl, down in georgia; came in her mouth. man, i thought i told ya
met this beautiful sexy ho; she just ran cross the border of mexico
fine young thing, said her name's maria. i wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
i wanna get married, but i can't afford it. i know i'ma cry when she gets deported

have you ever went over to a girl's house to fuck, but the pussy just ain't no good? (say what?)
and then you're getting' upset cause you can't get her wet, plus you in the wrong neighborhood?
so you try to play it off and eat the pussy, but it takes her so long to come (say what?)
then a dude walks in. that's her big boyfriend, and he asks you where you from? (where you from, man?)
so you wipe your mouth, and you try to explain (i don't bang.), you start talkin' real fast
but he's already mad, cause you fuckin' his wife, so he starts beatin' on your ass
now your clothes all muddy, your nose all bloody, your dick was hard but now it's soft. (whut?)
you thought you had a girl to rock your world, now you still gotta go jack off

take the bass line out
uh-huh, jigga
uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah

it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!


from standin' on the corners, boppin'
to drivin' some of the hottest cars new york has ever seen
from droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
from the dope spot, with the smoke glock
fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
from nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
but since when y'all niggas know me to fail? fuck naw
where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
and if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
i'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
and sip the cris' and get pissy-pissy
flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby!
you know it's hell when i come through
the life and times of shawn carter, nigga, volume 2
y'all niggas get ready!


it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!


i flow for those 'dro'ed out
all my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
we live in hard knocks
we don't take over, we borrow blocks
burn 'em down and you can have it back
daddy, i'd rather that
i flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
i see your vision, mama
i put my money on the longshots
all my ballers that's born to clock
know i'ma be on top whether i perform or not
i went from lukewarm to hot
sleepin' on futons and cots to king size
green machines, to green 5's
i've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
then i put it down type braille
i'm tight grill with the phony
rappers, y'all might feel we homies
i'm like, ""still, y'all don't know me.""
shit, i'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
i'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?


it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!
it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!


i don't know how to sleep, i gotta eat, stay on my toes
got a lotta beef, so logically, i prey on my foes
hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
you'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
i gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
so i stretched the game out, etched your name out
put jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!


it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked

The Watcher|Dr. Dre|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
things just ain't the same for gangstas
times is changin', young niggas is agin'
becoming ogs in the game and changin'
to make way for these new names and faces
but the strangest things can happen from rappin'
when niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
i've seen 'em come, i've watched 'em go
watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
best friends and money: i lost them both
went and visited niggas in the hospital
it's all the same shit all across the globe
i just sit back and watch the show (the watcher)


'cause everywhere that i go
ain't the same as befo' (the watcher)
people i used to know
just don't know me no mo' (the watcher)
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know (the watcher)
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low (i watch)


i moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
but niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
i'm out of sight, now i'm out of they dang reach
how would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
you'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
and choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
i ain't a thug, how much 2pac in you you got?
i ain't no bitch, neither
it's either my life or your life and i ain't leavin', i like breathin'
'cause nigga, we can go round for round
clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
i got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
when you wanna come and fill these shoes (the watcher)


'cause everywhere that i go
ain't the same as befo' (the watcher)
people i used to know
just don't know me no mo' (the watcher)
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know (the watcher)
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low (i watch)


things just ain't the same for gangstas
cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
they wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
then they wonder why we act so outrageous
run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'cause every time you let the animal out cages
it's dangerous to people who look like strangers
but now we got a new era of gangstas
hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
lookin' at us, now callin' us busters
can't help but reminisce back when it was us
nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
and this the motherfuckin' thanks i get?
it's funny how time flies
i'm just having fun just watchin' it fly by (the watcher)


'cause everywhere that i go
ain't the same as befo' (the watcher)

demonic chapters shall be captured by kings
through the storms of days after
unto the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
the brainwave causes vessels to circulate

seeking everlasting life through this hell for what it's worth

heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
the righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
cannot afford to be confined to a cell

...man, whatever


dre, just let it run
ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
ayo
this song is for anyone...
fuck it, just shut up and listen
ayo


i sit back with this pack of zig-zag's and this bag
of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this... on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension, dispensin' these sentences
gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
of this chest and i rest again peacefully (peacefully)
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me), i don't know you
and no, i don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
i'm not mr. n'sync, i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr. friendly, i can be a prick
if you tempt me, my tank is on empty (is on empty)
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm liftin' you ten feet (liftin' you ten feet) in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you (of all you), i don't mean to be mean
but that's all i can be, it's just me


and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
i don't know, that's just the way i am


sometimes i just feel like my father, i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense, it's constant
and, ""oh, it's his lyrical content
the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)
so i point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn (on marilyn) and the heroin
where were the parents at? and look where it's at!
middle america, now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
havin' this happenin' (this happenin') then attack
eminem 'cause i rap this way (rap this way) but i'm glad
'cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire to burn
and it's burnin', and i have returned


and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
i don't know, that's just the way i am


i'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on ""my name is""
and pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
and i just do not got the patience (got the patience)
to deal with these cocky caucasians
who think i'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause i talk
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always
keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
what school did i go to, what hood i grew up in
the why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'til i'm grabbin' my hair and i'm tearin' it out
'cause they drivin' me crazy (drivin' me crazy), i can't take it
i'm racin', i'm pacin', i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom without
someone standin' by it! (standin' by it) no, i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole, i'm glad


'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am

what they think about me for the last few months
it's too loud
maybe it's time i tell 'em what i think about them
can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot it's too loud
three’s not a crowd all up in it, slow fire


don't fall on my face
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate
don't fall on my–


gotta concentrate, against the clock i race
got no time to waste, i'm already late, i got a marathoner's pace
went from addict to a workaholic, word to dr. dre
in that first marijuana tape—guess i got a chronic case (yeah)
and i ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
i know this time paul and dre
they won't tell me what not to say (nope!)
and though me and my party days
have all pretty much parted ways
you'd swear to god i forgot i'm the guy that made ""not afraid""
one last time for charlamagne
if my response is late, it's just how long it takes
to hit my fuckin' radar, i'm so far away
these rappers are like hunger games
one minute, they're mockin' jay
next minute, they get their style from migos or they copy drake
maybe i just don't know when to turn around and walk away
but all the hate, i call it ""walk on water"" gate
i've had as much as i can tolerate
i'm sick and tired of waitin', i done lost my patience
i can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
you wanted shady? you got him!


don't fall on my face (yeah)
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
don't fall on my fate (look)


somebody tell budden before i snap, he better fasten it
or have his body bag get zipped
the closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (pump it up!)
and don't make me have to give it back to akademiks
say this shit is trash again, i'll have you twisted
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
even when i'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
lackin' with it, ""he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
ho, you better go back and listen
you know me better, thinkin' i'll slow or let up
call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
hopin' that you rappers fall in that
dre said, ""hold your head up!""—kathy griffin
stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
this is how i shot ahead (pew)—gabby giffords
my attack is vicious, jack the ripper, back in business
tyler create nothin', i see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
it's not just 'cause you lack attention
it's because you worship d12's balls, you're sack-religious
if you're gonna critique me
you better at least be as good or better
get earl the hooded sweater
whatever his name is to help you put together
some words, more than just two letters
the fans waited for this moment like that feature
when i stole the show (ha), sorry if i took forever (haha)


don't fall on my face (yeah)
don't fall on my faith, oh (i won't)
don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)


just remember, i was here before you
and i'll be here after you make your run-in for you
detractors, i might have to fuck pitchfork with a corkscrew
just what the doctor ordered
revenge is the best medicine
increase the dose, from least to most
and then tell the grammys to go and fuck themselves
they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
so they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to mc the show
every parasite needs a host (haha)
then give album of the year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
all i know is i wrote every single word to
everything i ever murdered
time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
and i got no faith in your writers, i don't believe in ghosts
when rap needed it most, i was that wing and a prayer
a beacon of hope, put a b-i-r-d in the air
somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
that's who i'm doin' it for, the rest i don't really even care
but you would think i'm carryin' an oxford dictionary in my pocket
how i'm buryin' these artists
on a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
and what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause i'm just barely gettin' started (woo!)
and far as lord jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
or i'll show you an elvis clone
walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
put my feet up and just make myself at home
i belong here, clown! don't tell me 'bout the culture!
i inspired the hopsins, the logics, the coles, the
seans, the k-dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
brought the world 50 cent, you did squat, piss and moan

Mo Money Mo Problems (feat. Mase & Puff Daddy)|The Notorious B.I.G.|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


now, who's hot, who not?
tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
you tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
whose jewels got rocks?
who's mostly dolce down to the tube sock?
the same old pimp, mase
you know ain't nothing change but my limp
can't stop till i see my name on a blimp
guarantee a million sales, call it level up
you don't believe in harlem world, nigga, double up
we don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
i'm the young harlem nigga with the goldie sound
can't no ph.d. niggas hold me down
cudda schooled me to the game, now i know my duty
stay humble, stay low, blow like hootie
true pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
and then you yell, ""there go mase!"", there go your cutie


i don't know what they want from me
it's like the more money we come across
the more problems we see


i'm the d to the a to the d-d-y
know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
i call all the shots, rip all the spots
rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
i know you thinking now, ""when all the ballin' stops?""
nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
ten years from now we'll still be on top
yo, i thought i told you that we won't stop
now what you gon' do with a crew
that got money much longer than yours
and a team much stronger than yours?
violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
mess around, be d.o.a., be on your way
‘cause it ain't enough time here
ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
deal with many women but treat dimes fair
and i'm bigger than the city lights down in times square


i don't know what they want from me
it's like the more money we come across
the more problems we see


b-i-g p-o-p-p-a
no info for the dea
federal agents mad ‘cause i'm flagrant
tap my cell and the phone in the basement
my team supreme, stay clean
triple beam lyrical dream, i be that
cat you see at all events bent
gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
playboy, i told ya, mere mics to me
bruise too much, i lose too much
step on stage, the girls boo too much
i guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
me lose my touch? never that!
if i did, ain't no problem to get the gat
where the true players at? throw your rolies in the sky
wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
while i give your girl the eye, player please
lyrically, niggas see b.i.g be flossin’
jig on the cover of fortune, 5-double-o
here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
i got the dough, got the flow down pizat
platinum plus like thizat
dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat

m.A.A.d city|Kendrick Lamar|hip-hop-rap-trap|"


if pirus and crips all got along
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time i'm in the street, i hear—
yawk! yawk! yawk! yawk!


man down, where you from, nigga?
fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
this m.a.a.d city i run, my nigga


brace yourself, i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me, l boog, and yan yan, yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
uh, warriors and conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
with society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day, i was lookin' at him different
that was back when i was nine, joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door, fuck is up?
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin' from ak's, ar's, ""ayy, y'all—duck!""
that's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' bgs up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies, ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
when we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
you movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, i guess
m.a.a.d. city


man down, where you from, nigga?

wake yo' punk-ass up!
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, real simple and plain
let me teach you some lessons about the street
(smoke somethin', nigga!)
hood ('sup, cuz?)
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, how we do


fresh outta school 'cause i was a high school grad'
sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
reality struck, i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job, i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact, i got fired, 'cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick a.k.a. ""compton's human sacrifice""


g-yeah, cocaine, weed
niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
dip, make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one time's crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra, rosecrans, bullis, it's compton


i'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
shit, the hood took me under, so i follow the rules
but yeah, that's like me, i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-by's in the hood lately, shit
couple of iv's with the fuckin' spray-can
shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
crew i'm finna slay, the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
mount up, regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
trip, we in the hood still
so, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand


if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
or see me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat?
if i mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn, they vandalizin' the option
of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive
hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
probably go to the projects, i
live inside the belly of the rough, compton, usa
made me an angel on angel dust - what?

Soundtrack 2 My Life|Kid Cudi|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i got 99 problems and they all bitches
wish i was jigga man, carefree livin'
but i'm not shawn, or martin louis
i'm that cleveland nigga rollin' with them brooklyn boys
you knowin' how it be when you start living large
i control my own life, charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the dram
or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time, my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
she copped the toys i would play with in my room by myself
""why he by himself?""
he got two older brothers, one hood, one good
an independent older sister kept me fly when she could
but they all didn't see
the little bit of sadness in me
scotty


i've got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring them to the light for you, it's only right
this is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life


i'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
since my father died, i ain't been right since
and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
split an eighth of shrooms just so i could see the universe
i try and think about myself as a sacrifice
just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room and soon i'm consumed by my doom
once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
it's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
so now i'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
my heart's an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of cancún
where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
so it's more than right, i try and shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand fame


i've got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring them to the light for you, it's only right
this is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life


i'm this close to go and trying some coke
and a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
ignorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss
ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then i'd prolly be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then i'd prolly be a jackass
don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see 30
wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty
i just need a thoroughbred, cook when i'm hungry
ass all chunky, brain is insanity
only things that calm me down: pussy and some cali tree
and i get both, never truly satisfied
i am happy, that's just the saddest lie


i've got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring them to the light for you, it's only right
this is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life


to my life, to my life, to my life…

yeah, uh-huh
yeah, uh-huh

The Formula|The D.O.C.|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
high energy flowin' with the wisdom
sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
this is what i'm using to come up with a style
so i'll interact altogether better with the crowd
nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
and i fall into the state of mind of what i'd just created
pump it like the dr. d into the r.e. suckers ready to leap
up on the tip when we made it
creative so i'll never be regarded as a regular
more than just a little bit better than my competitor
you should never underestimate the fashion
i hold for the stage whether i'm coolin' or thrashin''
clockin' the concoction created by me
when read you read e = the d.o. to the c
knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
equals an artist that won't be worn, what is that dre?


it's the formula


it's like a message that only i could understand
but those who want to comprehend will again
be in the midst of the brother
unlike another in any way
cause dre don't play, say what the other say
originality is a must whenever i bust
a funky composition, it's crush and i trust that you
know it when you hear a funky record with potential
me gettin' hype cause dre rockin' the instrumental
nothing like what you've heard before and more, never less
see i don't fess, i mean i'm like fresh if not the freshest
when i'm expressin' my thoughts on
vinyl, you can't help but listen up and get caught on
hooked because i cook when i pick up a pen
and begin, in the end it's dope, that's cause i want to win
knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
equals the doc, what is it dre?


yo, man, that's the formula


keepin' it dope as long as i can like imagine
makin' each record that i do better than the last one
take a little time, choose the topic and drop it
release it, the science of makin' dope beats with
rhythmic american poetry
shipped it to stations, now many people know of me
i'm the d. into the o. and the o. into the c. and the c. into the period
suckers are fearin' this
when heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
and take just a second to get caught up in my record
new but not a kid to be worn
if something gettin' torn up then i'm doin' the
tearin', not bein' torn
shapin' up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
and when you hear of this
you shouldn't choke on this
knowledge and the talent makes it valid
for me to get it patented
dre, tellin' what i'm rappin'


the formula


in effect and i'm smooth, that's why i'm on the incline
suckers frontin' for nothin' cause i'm goin' to get mine
it's in the cards and i think i might have read this
so don't lie and try to front like someone said this
most who know thoughts served by the doc see
that it's a mission impossible, tryin' to rock me
for an arena who'd ask me to perform for her
g.o. and easily i flow and ya know usin' the formula"

these are the results of a thousand electric volts
a neck with bolts
nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
and i might snap, one day just like that
i decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
my first day in junior high, this kid said
""it's you and i, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die""
i looked at my watch, it was 1:20
""i already gave you my lunch money
what more do you want from me?""
he said, ""don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
my palms were sweaty, and i started to shake at first
somethin' told me, ""try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
i screamed, ""ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
teacher, teacher, quick, i need a naked nurse""
""what's the matter?""
""i don't know, my leg, it hurts""
""leg? i thought you said it was your tummy""
""oh, i mean it is, but i also got a bum knee""
""mr. mathers, the fun and games are over

brain damage


way before my baby daughter hailie
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named deangelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
so every day he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin'
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
but he just wouldn't leave
he kept chokin' me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said, ""you gonna die, honky""
the principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(what's going on in here?)
i made 'em think they beat me to death
holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it 'til i broke the wood
knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
made it home later that same day
started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryin' to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin', ""what are you on, drugs?!
look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug"" (i'm sorry)
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed, ""look, bitch, what have you done?""
""oh my god, i'm sorry, son""
shut up, you cunt
i said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck


brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'
but everywhere i go, they keep playin' my song

it's gettin close to the end y'all
but we gonna kick it like this on the last album


now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
in your ear for a minute, quit complainin'
'bout how you can't spend it 'cause you ain't got it
you got what it takes but not enough to get started
i hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
i'm still hungry, i want some more stuff
get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
so get yours, and buy my new album
peep the game and don't be like calvin
get everything you want, get real, get your mail
get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
you should be gettin it, everything you want
everything you dreamed of, never have to front
you should be gettin it, gettin money
i'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
you should get a good lawyer, like johnnie cochran
swear to tell the truth, 'hell nah i didn't pop him'
get your kids in school so they can get an education
get a degree, and take a vacation
you see i got all my game from the streets of california
young millionaire with no high school diploma
livin real good, taking care of my folks
roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
short dog's in the house, i know you ain't trippin'
'cause life is too $hort, you gotta get in where you fit in
stop looking for what you never seem to find
it ain't what you think, you got to read between the lines
'cause life ain't long for a young black man
tryin' to make money doing all he can
sellin' dope, don't ya hope he would go to class
but the boy makes money and he makes it fast
with the twenties on top and the fifties on bottom
a flock a top notches, oh yes, we got 'em
it's been a long time since i first got down
but i still keep makin' these funky sounds


get your money, mayne
get yours


you should be gettin' it
get it while the gettin' is good, get it while you can
you should be gettin' it
get it while the gettin' is good


get your money, mayne
get yours
you should be gettin' it


i know you tired of bein' broke, just hangin' out
you gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
the first thing you need to do is set yourself some goals
think positive, everything else is old
and work hard, never stop hustlin'
'cause they just love to see the black man strugglin'
(so what are you sayin', todd?)
it's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
he said meet me at the white house and i was there
'cause i'm one in a million, black men risin'
they wanna keep me down but i always surprise 'em
spend my money in the 'hood, i know it's all good
and you should do the same, i told you peep the game
from too $hort, you know i'm the man
i lend my brother a hand 'cause i know i can
i keep goin' and goin' but i'm not the pink bunny
i'm not beatin' on a drum, i never stop thinking money
i'm gettin' all i can, if you don't, ya slip
i can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
when i was broke, i couldn't afford a meal
but now i'm now rich, i can't be fake, i gots to keep it real
it's been a long time baby since i first got down
but it still keep makin' these funky sounds




i earned my respect in the street
the ghetto's been good to me
i'm never going to turn my back
the true and living so i gots to kick the facts

i don't give a fuck, praise god, i could see the light
everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
i wish i could erase that, face facts


everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
everybody love, everybody know, how it go

Moment Of Truth|Gang Starr|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
no matter what we face
we must face the moment of truth, baby


they say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
you always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
we all must meet our moment of truth


the same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
it's universal; you play with fire it may hurt you
or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
let's face facts, although mcs lace tracks
it doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
that goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
it's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
but i can't jeopardize what i have done up to this point
so i'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
cultivate, multiply, motivate, or else we'll die
you know i be the master of the who, what, where and why
see when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
always selfish jealous punks will wanna pull ya
down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
but just as you'll receive what is coming to you
everybody else is gonna get theirs too
i ain't no saint, therefore i cannot dispute
that everyone must meet their moment of truth


actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
you may not know the hardships people don't speak up
it's best to step back, and observe with couth
for we all must meet our moment of truth


sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
why do bad things happen to good people?
seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
the situation that i'm facin' is mad amazin'
to think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
now i'm contemplating in my bedroom, pacin'
dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
suicide? nah, i'm not a foolish guy
don't even feel like drinking or even getting high
'cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
the anxieties that i wish i could alleviate
but wait, i've been through a whole lot of other shit, before
so i oughta be able to withstand some more
but i'm sweating though, my eyes are turning red, and yo
i'm ready to lose my mind, but instead i use my mind
i put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
my only crime was that i'm too damn kind
and now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
but they can't take the respect that i've earned in my lifetime
and you know
they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
so like they say, every dog has its day
and like they say, god works in a mysterious way
so i pray, remembering the days of my youth
as i prepare to meet my moment of truth

""you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!""


yo, i got one lyric pointed at your head for start
another one is pointed at your weak ass heart
now if i pull the trigger on these fully loaded lines
you're gonna wish i would've pulled a black 9
i mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
yeah the biting trifling niggas and the studio pranksters
yo, looking at the situation plainly: will you remain, g?
or will you be looked upon strangely?
i reign as the articulator, with the greater data
revolving on the tascam much doper than my last jam
while others struggle to juggle, tricky metaphors
i explore more to expose the core
a lot of emcees act stupid to me
and we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
but anyway, it's just another day
another fake jack i slay with my spectac' rap display
styles, smooth but rugged -- you can't push or shove it
you dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
the king of monotone, with my own throne
righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
storming your hideout, blocking out your sunlight
your image and your business were truly not done right
throw up your he allah now divine saviours
you got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
no pager, no celly, no drop top benz-y
i came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
my art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'cause you must meet your moment of truth


they say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
you always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
no one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
we all must meet our moment of truth"

it's a package deal: you rob me, you take these missiles
along with that, i ain't your average cat
fuck rap, i'm tryna make cream and that's that
whatever it takes, however, it gots to go down
four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four pound
speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
i could truly care less, the god gon' get his regardless
blow-for-blow, let's find out who wear hardest
this rap artist used to be a stickup artist
sometimes i test myself, see if i still got it
a live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
or forget the essence from which i emerged
p is sick so save that bullshit for the birds
live up to my word, if i got beef niggas comin' in herds
we flush through, your clique get purged"

k-dot back in the hood, nigga!
i'm mad (he mad!), but i ain't stressin'
true friends, one question


bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
when you got the yams—(what's the yams?)


the yam is the power that be
you can smell it when i'm walkin' down the street
(oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
i can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
what the fuck happened? (oh no!)
i swore i wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (a two-man cell)
something's in the water (something's in the water)
and if i gotta brown-nose for some gold
then i'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
this shit is elementary, i'll probably go to jail
if i shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""compton!""
i should probably run for mayor when i'm done, to be honest
and i put that on my momma and my baby boo too
20 million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
aw, yeah, fuck the judge
i made it past 25, and there i was

Not Afraid|Eminem|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i’m not afraid (i’m not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we’ll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road


yeah, it's been a ride
i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
now some of you might still be in that place
if you're tryna get out, just follow me
i'll get you there


you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
'cause ain't no way i'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
when i say i'ma do somethin', i do it
i don't give a damn what you think, i'm doin' this for me
so fuck the world, feed it beans
it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
i'ma be what i set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
and all those who look down on me
i'm tearin' down your balcony
no ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album he's still shittin'
whether he's on salary, paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first, for better or worse
he's married to the game
like a ""fuck you"" for christmas, his gift is a curse
forget the earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
and fuck the whole universe


i’m not afraid (i’m not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we’ll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road


okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
for you to know it's a rap
you said you was king, you lied through your teeth
for that, fuck your feelings
instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
and to the fans, i'll never let you down again, i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise
in fact, let's be honest, that last relapse cd was ""ehh""
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax, i ain't goin' back to that now
all i'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'cause i ain't playin' around
there's a game called circle and i don't know how
i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out, but i guess i didn't
this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
but it's time to exorcise these demons
these muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now


i’m not afraid (i’m not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we’ll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road


and i just can’t keep livin' this way
so startin' today
i’m breakin' out of this cage
i’m standin' up, i'ma face my demons
i’m mannin' up, i'ma hold my ground
i’ve had enough, now i’m so fed up
time to put my life back together right now


it was my decision to get clean, i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
so i could come back a brand-new me
you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did, believe me you
i've been through the wringer
but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye, i feel like the king of
my world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead: no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on, i promise
to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
‘cause the way i feel, i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
‘cause i'm raisin' the bar
i'd shoot for the moon, but i'm too busy gazin' at stars
i feel amazin', and i'm—


i’m not afraid (i’m not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we’ll walk this road together, through the storm

(hear me live and direct)
(walk with your tap)


yeah, in london talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
i thought the album was finished but i keep writing shit
it's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
no matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
the incredible album, what an incredible outcome
i grip the mic and then talk to the people like i'm malcolm
i used to think the fame and money was the motivation
until i toured the world and met the people face to face and
understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
it ain't about the money and notoriety
it's about the people and making a difference in society
but don't get it twisted, this life i'm living is like a movie
the godfather, the goodfella wielding a uzi
one with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
same level, the same rebel that never settled
pullin' strings like geppetto who overcame the ghetto
and i know you wrote me and i still ain't answered
'cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
i used to spend all my time conversing with you
but now i write this song to let you know i'm hurting with you
shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
and even then, that shit is rare—i just don't go outside
'cause honestly i don't fuck with this world, i'd rather hide
that misconception, ""'cause i rap, i must be filled with pride""
shit i ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
people in my ear telling me, ""talk that shit""
actions speak louder than words, i'd rather walk that shit
since the first album, i'm one of the highest earners on the label
within six months i put the second one on they table
i played sold out shows in parts of the world i can't pronounce
release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
the mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
leave friday for the show and come back monday with a hundred grand
don't fuck with checks, so when i bounce i prefer cash in hand
you know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
there's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when i ain't have shit
felt like i woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
thank god, he never let lucifer close enough to ask
let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
at least i don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
i got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
damn! that's the fattest stoge i ever seen
the weather's heat in cali
gettin' weeded makes it feel like maui
now we feel the good vibrations
so many females, so much inspiration


i get inspired by the blunts too
i'll front you, if you hang with a bunk crew
i roam the strip for bones to pick
when i find one, i'm done
take her home and quickly do this (yep)
i need not explain this (nah)
a-plus is famous, so get the amos


hey, miss! who's there? i'm through there
no time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
you look great–let's grub now
a rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theatre
we in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
take her to the crib so i can stroke her


kids get broke for their skins when i'm in
close range, i throws game at your dip

another person's business, i cause dizziness
until you stop acting like a silly bitch


yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
the cops, wanna stop our fun, but the top
is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
i work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
under their noses, this bro's quick
they hit blunts and flip once
i'm chillin', ‘cause my crew's close, kid


i'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
i exit, ‘cause i'm an exception to the rule
i'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
to snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam b
blam leakin' out his pocket
so i got tons of indo and go to the owen's basement
my ace been fattenin' up tracks
time to get prolific with the whiz kid


greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
who got the fat sacks? we can max pumpin' fat tracks
exchangin' facts about impacts, ‘cause in facts
my freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
they lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 'til infinity – kill all that wack shit!

i be coolin', school's in session, but i'm fresh in
rappin', so i take time off to never rhyme soft
i'm off on my own shit
with my own clique, roll many backroads
with a fat stog' and blunt, foldin' runts
holdin' stunts captive with my persona
plus a bomber, zestin'
niggas is testin' my patience, but i stay fresh, and…


restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid
but i am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
some ill fits, some new kicks
i often do this, ‘cause it's the pits not being dipped


flip the flyer attire females desire
baby, you can step to this if you admire
the extraordinary, dapper rapper
keep tabs on your main squeeze before i tap her


i'll mack her, attack her with the smoothness
i do this, peepin' what my crew gets (huh)
loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smack!)
they bite flows, but we make up new ones
if you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
but i get my loot from jive/zomba
i'ma bomb ya; you will see, from now 'til infinity

half the niggas in the squad got a scar on their face
it's a cold world and this is ice
half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
got the phantom in front of the building, trinity ave
ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
as a youngin, was too much to cope with
why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me cook coke shit?
should've been called armed robbery
extortion, or maybe grand larceny
i did it all, i put the pieces to the puzzle
just as long, i knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
came out the gate on some flo-jo shit
fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid


i said my niggas don't dance

my niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
we gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
so never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
and we walk around the metal detectors
and there really ain't a need for a v.i.p section
in the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
now that's what the fuck i call a chain reaction
see, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

this is why i sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
you can find joe crack at all type of shit
out in vegas front row to all the fights and shit
if 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
cause half these rappers they blow like derek foreal
if you cross the line, damn right i'm gon' hurt you

i find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, i know
luckily i didn't have to grow there
i would only go there cause niggas that i know there
i don't know what's getting into me, i just like the rush
when you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
you ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
people like mazin who was a best friend to me
start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
and this life started lacking synergy
and fuckin' with me mentally, i think it's meant to be

umm, premo, nas
yeah, yeah, yo
(nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is; nas is;
nas is like)


freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
as far as rap go, it's only natural i explain
my plateau, and also, what defines my name
first it was nasty, but times have changed
ask me now, i'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
i spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
saw my close friends shot, flatline, am i sane?
that depends, carry mac-10s to practice my aim
on rooftops, tape cd covers to trees
line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
to the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
to the big dogs living large, taking in light
pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
it's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
and of course n-a-s are the letters that spell (nas, nas, nas)


nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (uh)

bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh nas
(nas is like) iron mike, messiah type
before the christ, after the death
the last one left, let my cash invest in stock
came a long way from blasting tecs on blocks
went from seiko to rolex, owning acres
from the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
can't take it with you under this earth
rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
they just rob your grave, i'd rather be alive and paid
before my number's called, history's made
some'll fall, but i rise, thug or die
making choices that determine my future under the sky
to rob, steal or kill, i'm wondering why
it's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is


nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (c'mon)
no doubt
nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing

(nas is like) sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
i'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
i'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
like greeks in egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
i'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
always got you, i’m like pop dukes you would cry for
i'm like a whole lot of loot, i'm like crisp money
corporate accounts from a rich company
i'm like ecstasy for ladies, i'm like all races
combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
bulletproof hummer man
i'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
i'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
i'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
live it and i write down and i watch it blow up
y'all know what i'm like, y'all play it your system every night, now


nas is like; life or death; i'm a rebel
my poetry's deep, i never fell
nas is like; half-man, half-amazing

wearin' jaz' chains, no tec's, no cash, no cars

i shot the sheriff


try to answer to the master or the mc rap god is no joke
on the lyric - it's hard to be modest
i knew i was the man with the master plan
to make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
just think while i sink, into the brain structure
(don't sleep on the e) you see, somethin' might rupture
it don't take time for me to blow your mind
take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
so just lounge.. cause you're a mc clown
go join the circus.. epmd's in town


total chaos -- no mass confusion
rhymes so hypnotizin' known to cause an illusion
like a magician.. who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
i pull them all like a .44 magnum
mc freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
it's travellin' the speed of light, but everything's motion
is frightening.. plus the thought you alone
you now enter dimension, called the twilight zone
you're terrified.. plus you can't bear the thought
you and i one-on-one, in the land of the lost
you start to shiver.. but then you scream, my friend
yo, wake up muttley, because you're dreamin' again
but next time i'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because i'm strictly business


i shot the sheriff


this is the rap season.. where the e starts pleasin'
girls around the world no need to be skeezin'
when i roll i stroll, cool always pack a tool
just in case.. a brother acts a fool
i've got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
put it in shock when i rock, give it up i'm not stingy
make sure i don't bore when i'm on the dance floor..
(get busy, boy) like you never saw before
rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. i'll pull your ho, boy
rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. i'll pull your ho, boy
rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. i'll pull your ho, boy
rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. i'll pull your ho, boy
(yo, you sniff blow?) .. hell no!
i got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
and my parents find out, then they start riffin'
so i stay, a-okay, cause i'm the e.. the r-i-c-k


mc's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
pulse rate descends.. heart rate increases
it's like beam me up, scotty, i control your body
i'm as deadly as aids when it's time to rock a party
and all due respect, when i say mic check
let a sucker slide once -- then i break his neck
so when i say jump, you reply, ""how high?""
because i'm takin' no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
you're just a soldier.. and i'm a green beret
i do not think twice about the mc's i slay
so if you want to battle, i highly recommend this:
bring your dog, mom, and dad.. because i'm strictly business


i shot the sheriff


yo yo, you're still pickin' on that four-leaf clover?
bring in the sandman, sucker.. because it's over
my name is erick sermon and i'm back again
i see the heads still turnin' and my so-called friends
they smile in my face -- behind my back they talk trash
mad and stuff -- because they don't have cash
like the e-double.. or the pmd
he drives a corvette, i drive a samurai suzuki
i'm a locksmith.. with the key to fame
never high on myself -- always stay the same
play a lot because i'm hot, like a horse i trot
around the track and back -- fatigued? no, i'm not


well i'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
to a fly girl that is good to go
with the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
cause when i am in action, there is no time for maxin'
or relaxin' -- just reactin' and subtractin'
on a sucker mc who mouth keeps on yappin' and flappin'
i lose my cool, then i'll start slappin' and smackin'
you wanna roll? then albee start jackin' and cappin'
no time to lounge, i'm packin' and strappin'
at my point of attack i soar at you like an eagle
i'm the sheriff, and bitin' is illegal
so next time in town, i highly recommend this
you gots to chill, because i'm strictly business"

ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
all my soldiers over there in iraq
e'rybody right here
what you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
stop lookin' at what you ain't got
start bein' thankful for what you do got
let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey


you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy cars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
so live your life (ayy! ayyy ayyy ayyy)
you steady chasin' that paper
just live your life (ohh! ayyy ayyy ayyy)
ain't got no time for no haters

my life (ayy) my life (ohh) just livin' my life


hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
amazing they ungrateful after all the game i gave away
safe to say i paved the way for you cats to get paid today
you'd still be wastin' days away now had i never saved the day
consider them my protege, homage i think they should pay
instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
i never been a hater, still, i love 'em in a crazy way
some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on labor day
it ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
i'm westside anyway, even if i left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
i brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
i pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
like i once made 'em spray, now i could make 'em put the k's away
been thuggin' all my life, can't say i don't deserve to take a break
you'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away


you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

just livin' my life (ayy) my life (ohh)
my life (ayy) my life (ohh) just livin' my life


i'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
articulate, but still i'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler tip
if that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow tip
i got love for the game, but ay i'm not in love with all of it
could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?


you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy cars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
so live your life (ayy! ayyy ayyy ayyy)
you steady chasin' that paper

just livin' my life (ayy) my life (ohh)

got everybody watchin' what i do, come walk in my shoes
and see the way i'm livin' if you really want to
got my mind on my money
and i'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
so keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
we gon' post up on the top spot
livin' the life, the life
in the windmill city got my whole team with me
the life, my life
i do it how i wanna do
i'm livin' my life, my life
i will never lose
i'm livin' my life, my life

Bucktown|Smif-N-Wessun|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i walk around town with the pound strapped down to my side
no fronting just in case i gotta smoke something
round here heads don't act their age
you might be another dead bwoy pon rage
enter the cipher with your lighter
l's are ready, prepare for another all nighter
but keep a watch for the cops cos they rock glocks
coming on the block trying to rock knots
pigs be acting like they bigger than us niggas from the streets
cos we stalk mad deep and dem walk beats
i guess dem hold a grudge cos i won't budge
playing tough, staring down the judge with my hands cuffed
standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear
au revoir yeah now i'm up outta here
pigs look me up and down with a frown
is it cos i'm brown or is it because i'm from bucktown?


bucktown!
home of the original gun clappers
(repeat x8)


got five mc that wanna contest we
got your nooses ready hanging over the trees
bring on your sounds and get drowned by my massive
kill you batty boy and hold your lover for hostage
knock knock niggy-knock that's four shots empty
on a violator that was sent out to get me
i'm tore up from the floor up and everything's black
but still i'm on point ready to buck, ain't nothing sweet, jack
bucktown, i represent it on the love love
deeply rooted from my timbs to my dick above
don't sweat the bulge coming from my hip
grip what you get hit when i let my tool click
nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark
heltah skeltah smirks while you're getting torn apart
here come the rude bwoys with the ganja plants
smif-n-wessun generals of the boot camp




another murderer, just another prankster
rude bwoy dead cause him thought him was a gangster
tried to live the life of a hood from the streets
test the wrong dread, now he's in eternal sleep
mr ripper i lurk in the stuy
twist up the ganja when i want to get high
with my bredren, a buddah session, learn your lesson
or get blasted by mr smif or mr wessun


bucktown's everywhere i swear
it's clear to me, you feel the weed, now i really see
nightfall round the way
original heads come out to play
puff herb, break day
it's just a regular, everyday state of being i
mind holds the weight, rhymes free the mind in time
i find reality follows me where i roam
360 degrees back home in...

Crooked Smile|J. Cole|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round


they tell me i should fix my grill ‘cause i got money now
i ain't gon' sit around and front like i ain't thought about it
a perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
my shit is crooked—look at how far i done got without it!
i keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
we ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
i got smart, i got rich and i got bitches still
and they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
love yourself, girl, or nobody will
though you a woman i don't know how you deal
with all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
i feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
you wake up, put makeup on
stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
no need to fix what god already put his paintbrush on
your roommate yelling, ""why you gotta take so long?!""
what it's like to have a crooked smile


even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down (this crooked smile)
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round (yeah)


to all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
you wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
you keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
and when i tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
so all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
take it from a man that loves what you got
and baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
now is it real? eyebrows, fingernails, hair
is it real? if it's not, girl, you don't care
‘cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
that the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
and that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
and if you need a friend to pick you up, i’ll be around
and we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
i can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
but i wanna see that crooked smile


even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round


we got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round


we don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
you know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
but we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
look at the nation
that’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in hell already
i ask: if my skin pale, would i then sell like eminem or adele?
but one more time for the 'ville
and fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
i got money for the bail now, and well now
if you askin' will i tell now—ayy, hell nah
i ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
if you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
how you like this crooked smile?


even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down (that crooked smile)
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round


we got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round




la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
la la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
back round
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
back round
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down

a couple of years ago on headland and delowe
was the start of something good
where me and my nigga rode the marta through the hood
just tryna find that hook up
now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
we caught the 86 lithonia headed to decatur
writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
like ""freeze!"" we making the crowd move
but we not making no g's and that's a no-no

full as a tick, i was stoned like them white boys
smoking them white golds before them blunts got crunk
chunky asses, passes getting thrown like hail mary's
and they looking like halle berry's
so so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
we's just chilling, i'm the rabid villain, and i'm so high
smoking freely, me, lil b, reek, mone and shug
and my little brother james, thangs changed in the hood
where i live at, them rats know, ""momma i want to sing
but momma i want to trick, and momma i'm sucking dicks now""
we moving on up in the world like elevators
me and the crew, we pimps like '82
me and you like tony toni tone

me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues

got stopped at the mall the other day
heard a call from the other way that i just came from
some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""no not really""
but he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
and he kept asking me, ""what kinda car you drive?
i know you paid, i know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
from all them songs that y'all done made""
and i replied that i had been going through the same things that he had
true, i've got more fans than the average man
but not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
i live by the beat like you live check-to-check
if it don't move your feet then i don't eat so we like neck-to-neck
yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
from virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

Lodi Dodi (feat. Nancy Fletcher)|Snoop Dogg|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga slick rick
for those who don't like it, eat a dick
but for those who with me, sing that shit
as it go a little something like this


lodi dodi, we likes to party
we don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
we're just some niggas who're on the mic
and when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
for all my doggs keepin' y'all in health
just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
cause it's cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
which we create, cause that's our mission
so listen close, to what we say
because this types of shit happens every day

i woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
i gave myself a strech, up, a morning yawn, and
went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said ""um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
who is the top dog of them all?""
there was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
the mirror said, ""you are, you conceited bastard!""
well that's true! that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file, for my fingernails
i'm true to the style on my behalf
i put some bubbles in the tub so i can take a bubble bath
clean, dry, was my body and hair
i threw on my brand new doggy underwear
for all the bitches i might take home
i got the johnson's baby powder and cool water cologne
now i'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
threw on my white socks, with my all-blue chucks
stepped out the house, stopped short, ""oh no""
i went back in, ""i forgot my indo!""
then i dilly (dally) i ran through an (alley)
i bumped into this smoker named (sally) from the (valley)
this was a girl playing hard-to-get
so i said ""what's wrong?"" cause she looked upset
she said um:


it's all because of you, i'm feeling sad and blue
you went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
i love you so, how much you'll never know
cause you took your dope away from me


damn, now what was i to do?
she's crying over me and she was feelin blue
i said, ""um, don't cry, dry your eye
and here comes your mother with those two little guys""
her mean mother steps then says to me ""hi!""
decked sally in the face and punched her in the eye
punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
slammed the child on the hard concrete
the bitch was strong, the kids was gone
something was wrong i said, ""what was goin on?""
i tried to break it up, i said, ""stop it, just leave her!""
she said, ""if i can't smoke none, she can't either!""
she grabbed me closely by my socks
so i broke the hell out, and i grabbed my sack of rocks
but um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
they started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
and saying

""why don't you give me a play
so we can break it down the long beach way
and if you give me that okay
i'll give you all my love today
doggy, doggy, doggy, can't you see?
somehow your words just hypnotize me
and i just love your jazzy ways
doggy dogg, your love is here to stay""

and on and on and on she kept going
the bitch been around before my mother born!
i said ""cheer up!"" and i gave her a hit
i said, ""you can't have me, i'm too young for you bitch!""
she said, ""no you're not!"" then she starts cryin
i says i'm 19, she says, ""stop lyin!""
i says, ""i am, go ask my mother
and with your wrinkled pussy, i can't be your lover""


yeah, uh, tick-tock ya don’t stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
yeah, n'ya tick-tock ya don’t stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
biatch!"

this rap here... it may cause concern it's
broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
love peace happiness... that once was strong
but due to society... even that's turned wrong
times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
and be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
have you forgotten... who put you on this earth?
who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
young little girls already have a child
bad company... hey, now you've been framed
your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
you're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
get ahead... and accomplish things
you'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
don't admire thieves 'cause... hey they don't admire you
their time's limited, hardrocks' too
so listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
go for yours, 'cause dreams come true
and you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too

and all jokes aside, are you in good health?
hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
you're a disgust, you know someone that i can't trust, you'd
steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
plus, a must say... bigshot you're not
your friends are talkin and i'm hearin that your girls are what?
you didn't know? go steal and rob
and while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
you see you're actin like this urge is demanding
c'mon, wake up... have some understanding
society's a weak excuse for a man
it's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
believe it or not, the lord still shines on you, he
guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
past the age of... a little child, that's true
but folks your age don't act like you do, so
so be mature... and put the point to a halt
and if you're over eighteen... i wish you'd act like an adult
don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
and if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
so be more mature... and kids do your chores
make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
you know why, 'cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
and a man never loses a fight... in god's sight
'cause righteous laws are overdue

ahh, real muthaphuckkin g's
ahh, real muthaphuckkin g's


hey yo, doctor, here's another proper track
and it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
and let that real shit provoke
see, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and i hope
that your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
the same records that you makin' is payin' me
motherfuck dre! motherfuck snoop! motherfuck death row!
yo, and here comes my left blow
'cause i'm the e-a-z-y-e and this is the season
to let the real motherfuckin' g's in
you're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
but tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
you're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(damn, e, they tried to fade you on dre day)
but dre day only meant eazy's payday
all of a sudden dr. dre is the g thang
but on his own album cover he was a she-thang
so, nigga please, nigga please
don't step to these muthaphuckkin' real g's


stop him in his tracks, show him that i am ruthless
yo, dre! (what's up?)
boy, you should've known by now


every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the dresta
softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
ain't broke a law in your life
yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
the fact that the master is simply just an actor
who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
of niggas in compton, watts, and south central
never ever once have you ran with the turf
but yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
but tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
so you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
this is goin' out to you studio gangstas
see, i did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
so since i got stripes, i got the right to rap about that
but niggas like you, i gotta hate ya
'cause i'm just tired of suburbia niggas
talkin' about they come from projects
knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, g
think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
and your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'cause you know they don't respect ya
so, nigga please, check nuts
before you step to these muthaphuckkin' real g's


well, it's the knocc out, definition ""original baby gangsta""
approach me like you hard, motherfucker, i'ma bank ya
shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if i have to
dr. dre and snoop doggy dogg are fuckin' actors
pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
but this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
g's, nigga please, don't try to step
'cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
see, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
claimin' my city — but dre, you ain't from compton
niggas like y'all is what i call wannabes
and ain't shit compared to real muthaphuckkin' g's


stop him in his tracks, show him that i am ruthless
yo, dre! (what's up?)
boy, you should've known by now


i never met a o.g. who never did shit wrong
you tried to diss the eazy-e, so now, nigga, it's on
you and your doggy dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
some niggas think it makes a man
damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
from wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
and now you think you're bigger
but to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
that ain't worth a food stamp
and at death row, i hear you gettin' treated like boot camp
gotta follow your sergeant's directions
or get your ass pumped with the smith & wesson
learn a lesson from the eaze
stay in your place and don't step to real muthaphuckkin' g's


stop him in his tracks, show him that i am ruthless
yo, dre! (what's up?)
boy, you should've known by now
stop him in his tracks, show him that i am ruthless
yo, dre! (what's up?)
boy, you should've known by now
stop him in his tracks, show him that i am ruthless

that said it all, it comes from inside, and how you ride
the sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right
catchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time
with lines, makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight
your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee
so listen please use discretion when you breath
sound is vibration, i choose to use it with a vision
and then comes the style and precision...


no more longer will we hold your hands
why? cause you're too damn old
oh yea, the network called
they told me to tell ya you've been cancelled
they also said big up for all the support
thanks to your devotion, they now control the world
so let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of tang
i'm rising past the bank, with smile i'm flashin my fangs
i tumble over some, cuz some i don't over stand
i got the plot from spawn, from now on, i know the plan


it's the noise it makes, that generates the passion i have
it's the void it breaks, that stimulates when mics get grabbed
it takes shape - escapes from these vocal chords i have
atmosphere: music makers from the rhymesayers lab


come now, who fi me gwan test the giants when we apply this
vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print
the tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced
don't breath a sigh of relief 'till you hear the rescue sirens


supreme, be this team, we got this shit on lock
rse we hid the key under an upscale rock
so you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in
you could try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in
nigga, what! my definition is raw, i got you all
wishin' i'd fall, so things could get better for y'all
but i'm tall, and got game, remain the same for the duration

area code 6-1-2, my present location...


atmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not abuse it
blessed with insight, friends and influences
thats what keeps us dope, what makes us dope is the surroundings
inspiration stems from love and stress compounding
stamina: that is achieved over the course of time
in fact, time taught me how to breath, battle, not to court my mind
defined as lyricist - the atmosphericist
makin sure you fear this hit every time you hear this shit

 sound is vibration
 this sound is taken
 sound is vibration
 and the ground is shaken
 vibration is sound
 yo, we found your replacement
 vibration is sound
 now who makes the sound?

 : now who makes the music/sound? (*fades out*)"
Pull The Trigger|Russ|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
yeah, eh, ah, nothing
pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
pull the trigger
maybe, you should pull the fuckin' trigger


pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot


yeah, why you believin' the propaganda?
why everybody sound like they wanna be from atlanta?
are you the voice or the echo?
are you the nail or the hammer?
i be talkin' while chewin' my beats, i don't mind my manners
choruses that fit the opera, that's why i need phantoms
i got my doubt at gun point, that's why i need ransoms
and i be handsome, that's why i got your girl before the money
honestly, i thought i'd have 30m's before my twenties
but i'm cool with how it's happenin'
girl in san fran. who wants to cross routes with me
like a young colin kaepernick
treat the money like a lateral, i'm passin' it
'cause my family's number one, never put 'em number two
tryna buy a house in cash for all the times we had to move
all the times my mom cried 'cause she ain't know what else to do
all the times she lost hope 'cause she ain't know what else to lose
all the times i shoot shots 'cause i don't know what else to shoot, man


pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot


i'ma stay winnin', i don't believe in luck
i believe that life's a buffet, better eat it up
i've seen enough to know that i'm really 'bout to blow
never felt like an employee, always felt like ceo
even when i stacked shoes, i was never clocked in
yeah, i always walked out, but i never walked in
that's a tribute to my head-space
and lately my devils have been spanish chicks in red lace
doing brujeria on me for ten days
more like ten months, but i got out of it
if i fall in love again, it's probably with a saudi chick
but i keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher, yo


pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot
pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you

you know what i'm sayin'?
‘cause we spendin' these jacksons
the washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
i'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
you know what i'm sayin'?
yo, then what, man, what?!


visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
and my mentality is money-orientated
i'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in san quentin
others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
keepin' this schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leavin' thievin'
we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
so, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘cause life's a bitch and then you die


life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye


i woke up early on my born day; i'm 20, it's a blessin'
the essence of adolescence leaves my body, now i'm fresh and
my physical frame is celebrated ‘cause i made it
one quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
load up the mic and bust one, cuss while i pus from
my skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
don't go against the grain, simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
and got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
now it's all about cash in abundance
niggas i used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
i switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""fuck tomorrow!""
that buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
once i stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage


life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high

Living Single|Big Sean|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
uh-huh, oh, yeah, look


okay i know what it feel like to be young and single
you know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
you know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
you know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
look, i know what it feel like to think you found the one
told mom that so many times that i'm sounding dumb
cause she started to mix ashley up with tanesha
and saying ""hi britney"" when i'm on the phone with lisa
fuck it, i got some new hoes, i mean some xxx girls
pussy get wet as an s-curl
then i started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
and how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
you know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(the number you dialed has been disconnected)
man, but before i started feeling bad
my nigga text me like ""i got some hoes, hit me back""
fuck it


oh i could let you down
when you trip, i'll take you anywhere, i take ya
we get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
you know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
with this crazy, crazy world
thank god i'm with my girl
we get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
you know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
with this crazy, crazy world
thank god i'm with my girl


you be the momma, you be the daddy
baby, we could play house, i'll change your addy
or even change my palate and fuck with salad
put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
can't even stunt i was sprung from the jump
never got head while flaming up the blunt
you were my first, i'm just saying
more folks should try it, it's crazy
focus, selfish moments, on road, i done have my share
flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
sleepy arguments via texts while i buy my beer
and the air so tired i forget to recline my chair
picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause simon says
ain't a single living thing that likes living single
we good over here, that's all that we know


oh i could let you down
when you trip, i'll take you anywhere, i take ya
we get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
you know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
with this crazy, crazy world
thank god i'm with my girl
we get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
you know it right if she ain't by my side
with this crazy, crazy world
thank god i'm with my girl


to the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
like my nigga henry, he married at 24
i'm like why nigga, why?
you supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
he like, ""ahhh""
fuck it, we about to do therapy
aye, at least when i hit the doctor i'm carefree with no plan b's
you probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
i'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
but i'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
it’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in whole foods
or how when i'm with her i feel whole too
go on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
fuck it, i started laughing and pretend like i ain't listen
even though he on target with everything i've been missing
the closest thing i had to that came in at 4 am and out at 8 for work
and i'm the reason we ain't make it work
that's what makes it worse
damn


oh i could let you down
when you trip, i'll take you anywhere, i take ya
we get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
you know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
with this crazy, crazy world
thank god i'm with my girl
we get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right

Run Me Dry|Bryson Tiller|hip-hop-rap-trap|"
i think she love me, 'cause i got the check on me
wan' spend the day and flex on me
put a curse and hex on me
scratch out my name, put the x on me
you should come check on me
talk dirty and caress on me

put a lot of stress on me
you used to obsess for me
call the station and request for me

aye, aye, aye, aye
used to break my neck for you
spend my paycheck on you
put my account in the red for you
damn near put myself in debt for you
you made me obsessed for you
thought i had the same effect on you
couldn't see i was the best for you
now you gotta figure out what's next for you
now you feel regret, oh, do you?

trust, i'm not even sweating you
you ran me dry, bet it gets to you (oh yeah)
out of respect for you
i curved bitches on the internet for you
i lost all respect for you
baby, it's my turn to flex on you


you're running me dry
oh girl, you're running me dry
cried my last tear drop
saw bad when i told 'em bring it here
